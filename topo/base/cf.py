"""
ConnectionField and associated classes.

This module defines some basic classes of objects used to create
simulations of cortical sheets that take input through connection
fields that project from other cortical sheets (or laterally from
themselves).

ConnectionField: Holds a single connection field within a
CFProjection.

CFProjection: A set of ConnectionFields mapping from a Sheet into a
ProjectionSheet.

CFSheet: A subclass of ProjectionSheet that provides an interface to
the underlying ConnectionFields in any projection of type
CFProjection.

        The norm_total property returns a value useful in computing

        By default, the value returned is simply the current sum of
        the connection weights.  However, another value can be
        substituted by setting norm_total explicitly, and this cached
        value will then be returned instead.

        This mechanism has two main purposes.  First, it allows a
        learning function to cache the sum value for an output
        function to use later without computation, which can result in
        significant time savings.  Second, the extra level of
        indirection allows the sum value to be manipulated before it
        is used, to implement operations like joint normalization
        across corresponding CFs in multiple Projections.

        Apart from such cases, norm_total can be ignored.
        
        Note that every person who uses a class that sets or gets
        norm_total must be very careful to ensure that stale values
        will never be accessed.  A good way to do this is to make sure
