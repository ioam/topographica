"""
Topographica cortical map simulator package.

Topographica is designed as a collection of packages from which
elements can be selected to model specific systems.  For more
information, see the individual subpackages::

  base           - Core Topographica functions and classes
  plotting       - Visualization functions and classes
  analysis       - Analysis functions and classes (besides plotting)
  tkgui          - Tk-based graphical user interface (GUI)
  command        - High-level user commands
  misc           - Various useful independent modules

The Topographica primitives library consists of a family of classes
that can be used with the above functions and classes::

  sheet          - Sheet classes: 2D arrays of processing units
  projection     - Projection classes: connections between Sheets
  pattern        - PatternGenerator classes: 2D input or weight patterns
  transferfn     - Transfer functions, for e.g. normalization or squashing
  responsefn     - Calculate the response of a Projection
  learningfn     - Adjust weights for a Projection
  coordmapper    - CoordinateMapperFn classes: map coords between Sheets

Each of the library directories can be extended with new classes of
the appropriate type, just by adding a new .py file to that directory.
E.g. new PatternGenerator classes can be added to pattern/, and will
then show up in the GUI menus as potential input patterns.

# just "import Image".  The code below means Image etc are always
# imported, but then the rest of topographica can consistently use
# Image (rather than a try/except, such as the one below). An
# alternative would be an import hook, which would only run on
# attempting to import Image etc.

# in new situations.
