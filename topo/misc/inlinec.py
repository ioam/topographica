"""
Interface class for inline C/C++ functions.  Based on the SciPy Weave package.

Weave (from SciPy) allows programmers to implement Python methods or
functions using C code written as a string in the Python file.  This
is generally done to speed up code that would be slow if written
directly in Python.  Because not all users can be assumed to have a
working C/C++ compiler, it is crucial for such optimizations to be
optional.  This file provides an interface for processing the inline
C/C++ code in a way that can gracefully revert back to the
unoptimized version when Weave is not available.

The fallback is implemented by making use of the way Python allows
function names to be overwritten, as in these simple examples:

  def x(y = 5): return y
  def x2(y = 6): return y*y
  print 'x:', x(), 'x2:', x2()  # Result -- x: 5 x2: 36
  x = x2
  print 'x:', x(), 'x2:', x2()  # Result -- x: 36 x2: 36

In this file, inline() is overwritten to call inline_weave() if Weave
is available.  If Weave is not available, inline() will raise a
NotImplementedError exception.  For a program to be usable without
Weave, just test inlinec.optimized after defining each optimized
component, replacing it with a non-optimized equivalent if
inlinec.optimized is False.

For more information on weave, see:
http://old.scipy.org/documentation/weave/weaveusersguide.html

Some of the C functions also support OpenMP, which allows them to use
multiple threads automatically on multi-core machines to give better
performance.  To enable OpenMP support for those functions, set
openmp=True in the main namespace before importing this file, and
(optionally) set openmp_threads to the number of threads desired.  If
openmp_threads is not set, then a thread will be allocated for each
available core by default.

Note that in order to use OpenMP, the C functions are obliged to use the
thread-safe portions of the Python/Numpy C API. In general, the Python
C API cannot be assumed to be thread safe.  Calls to PyObject_SetAttrString
are a common hazard which can often be avoided using LOOKUP_FROM_SLOT_OFFSET.
This makes use of Python's __slots__ mechanism with the added benefit of
bypassing the GIL.
