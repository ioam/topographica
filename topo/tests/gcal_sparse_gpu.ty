Model equivalent to examples/gcal.ty before moving to class-based
approach. This version uses sparse representation for projections and GPU for calculations.

This script is used to test against gcal_sparse.ty_DATA. This was the
original training test data for the GCAL model (the first version of
gcal.ty_DATA) and should match nearly identically with gcal.ty_DATA.
