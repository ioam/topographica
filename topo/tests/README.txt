Topographica Unit Tests  Package

##############################################################
CEBALERT: this document is out of date. Also, this directory
is a mess!
- runtests.py: crude Python Makefile replacement (start here).
- __init__.py: unit test runner
- test_script.py: various functions to generate and compare data, test
  snapshots, etc.
- gui_tests.py: beyond unit tests of the GUI
- utils.py: not much, but some functions used (or once used) in
  multiple places
- test_map_measurement.py: map measurement tests
- test*.py: unit test files
- test*.txt: doctest files
- *_DATA: generated by test_script.py for comparison of simulation
   results
- *.data: generated by test_map_measurement.py
- *.pickle: generated by test_script.py for pickle tests
- reference/: c++ lissom comparisons

This package contains unit test modules for topographica.  The
Makefile in the main Topographica directory shows how to run the
tests, typically by doing:

  make tests

To run only a subset of the tests, you can specify the module names
explicitly:

  ./topographica -c 'import topo.tests.testimage; topo.tests.run(test_modules=[topo.tests.testimage])'


To add new tests modules.

1. Add a module to this directory containing unit tests defined using
   Python's standard 'unittest' module.  Each test module should define
   a variable 'suite' containing the entire test suite for that module.
   See testdummy.py for a template file.

2. Edit the file __init__.py, adding an import line for your module.
   The package initialization code will take care of adding your
   module's test suite to the Topographica test suite.

Note that there need not be a 1-1 correspondence between test modules
and topographica modules.  For example, a special test module designed
to test the interaction between two topographica modules would be
fine.  However, large-scale integration or functional tests should be
separated out from these unit tests, because the unit tests are
designed to be easily updated when units change, and need to run
quickly so that the unit tests can be run at least daily, and usually
more often, during development.
