Topographica comes with the following step-by-step guides to running
simulations: 

<P><DL>
<DT><A href="gcal.html"><strong>GCAL Orientation Map</strong></A></DT>
<DD>How to run and test a simple orientation map simulation using the
GCAL cortical model.  The tutorial allows you to present various
objects to a saved orientation map network, and to visualize and
analyze the responses.  It also shows how to develop a new simulation
using different input patterns.</DD><BR>

<DT><A href="lissom_oo_or.html"><strong>LISSOM Orientation
Map</strong></A></DT> <DD>Same tutorial as for GCAL, but using the
older, more complex, less robust LISSOM model, which has been more
extensively described in publications.</DD><BR>

<!--
<DT><A href="lissom_or.html"><strong>LISSOM Orientation Map without ON/OFF</strong></A></DT>
<DD>Simpler version of the above tutorial, consisting of one input region (Retina)
and one cortical region (V1)</DD><BR>
-->

<DT><A href="som_retinotopy.html"><strong>SOM Retinotopic Map</strong></A></DT>
<DD>How to run a model that develops selectivity for position, mapping
the input space to the cortical space.  The model uses the abstract
SOM algorithm, focusing on the basic principles of self-organization
rather than modeling any particular biological system.

These should be good starting points for seeing how Topographica works
and how to use a Topographica model.  If you develop any other
tutorials for your own models, we would love to add them here!
