There are a number of mailing lists available for those interested
in Topographica. Click on each one for information about signing up
to the list, unsubscribing, or accessing the list archives.

`topographica-announce`_
    Mailing list for announcing significant releases and other
    important news. Should have very low traffic, and will not clog
    your inbox, and is thus suitable for anyone interested in
    Topographica.
`topographica-developers`_
    Mailing list for members of the Topographica development team.
    Relatively low traffic, except for occasional short bursts of
    discussion.
`topographica-cvs`_
    Mailing list announcing changes made to any Topographica file in
    the Git repository. Very high traffic (sometimes several emails
    per day), and likely to be of interest only for active
    developers.

Posting to these lists is restricted to Topographica developers.
Users wishing to communicate with Topographica developers or other
users should create `GitHub Issues`_, e.g. for discussing problems,
reporting bugs, or requesting new features.  For information on how to
track down problems and how to file effective bug reports, please see
our guidelines for `Reporting specific problems with Topographica`_.
