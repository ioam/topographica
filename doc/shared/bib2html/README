Important news for people who already use bib2html:

  The way that the bibsearch CGI script is called from HTML has changed
  in bib2html-1.25.  Read the comments at the beginning of bibsearch
  for the new calling conventions.


Installation:

* Update the first line of bib2html and bibsearch to point to the
  location of perl on your local machine.

* Install html-*.bst somewhere that bibtex can find them.  If you have
  installed an earlier version of bib2html, remove html.bst and
  html-abs.bst.

* If you plan to use the bibsearch CGI script, edit the configuration
  section at the beginning of it and install it in your http server's
  cgi-bin directory.  The script has comments with instructions on how
  to call it from another HTML page.

* If you want to modify the bst (bibtex style) files, edit
  html-btxbst.doc and then run gen-bst to generate the new versions.
  You probably won't need to, though.

* To support the -r, -c, and -a options, there are now 18 possible
  style files.  Rather than generate and install all of these .bst
  files by default, gen-bst now only generates the ones that are most
  likely to be used.  To create the missing ones (that is, if you plan
  to use the -r and -c options), uncomment the lines at the end of
  gen-bst and re-run it.


GNU emacs:

  For use with bibtex mode (available at
  http://www.ida.ing.tu-bs.de/people/dirk/bibtex/),
  I add the following to my ~/.emacs file:

  (setq bibtex-user-optional-fields
  '(("url" "URL link (for bib2html)")
    ("postscript" "PostScript file (for bib2html)")
    ("pdf" "PDF file (for bib2html)"))
    ("dvi" "DVI file (for bib2html))
