================
Output directory
================

The directory contains all the output generated by the
``stevens_jn13.ipynb`` notebook. This includes all the simulation
data needed to build the figures and a build directory for the
dynamically generated figures ``build_dir``. These directories
will appear when the ``stevens_jn13.ipynb`` notebook is run. It
also includes experimental data extracted from `Kaschube et
al. (2010)
<http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6007/1113.abstract>`_ and
`Chapman et al. (1996)
<http://www.jneurosci.org/content/16/20/6443>`_ in the file
``experimental_data.json``. Note that a notebook showing how the
experimental data was processed may be included in the future.

Note that the contents of this directory will continuously grow
in size as jobs are launched from
``stevens_jn13.ipynb``. Approximately 5.3GB is needed to hold the
simulation data if all the figures are to be reproduced.
