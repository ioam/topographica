Topographica is a general-purpose neural simulator focusing on
topographic maps.  The simulator is under continuous development, and
scripts developed for one version are likely to need modification to
run with subsequent versions.  Saved snapshot files will often
continue to work with new versions, but they are not guaranteed to do
so.

This program is free, open-source software available under the BSD
license (see LICENSE.txt).


This Topographica package is designed to be installed into an existing
Python environment (e.g. Python(x,y) on Windows, or EPD on
Mac). Please see http://Topographica.org/Downloads for instructions
and links to all packages.
