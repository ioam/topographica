	* jbednar: Merge pull request #492 from wiktr/etc_removal

	* wiktor: Removed all SVN-style __version__="$Revision$" logic in
	preparation for the new git-based versioning; files that store a
	specific __version__ (not just "$Revision$"), or actually do
	anything with __version__, or are external files get to keep their
	__version__ property (FOR NOW!).

	file any more

	  shortcut to work with other targets.

	* [r12008] topo/misc/picklemain.py: Take account of IPython

	* [r12004] topo/command/__init__.py: Reconsidered need for the
	  new embed_scriptname parameter in run_batch (now removed).
	  Probably best to always record ty filenames regardless (in
	  case files are moved out of their original directory.)

2012-04-17 jbednar

	* [r12003] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py,
	  topo/command/analysis.py, topo/command/pylabplot.py: Changes
	  from Alessio to fix maptests -- Treat selectivity as always
	  non-cyclic, pass preference_fn more consistently, added
	  selectivity_scale where needed to preserve older results.
	
	  Should make maptests work; have been broken since r11904.

2012-04-17 jlstevens

	* [r12002] doc/User_Manual/multicore_text.php,
	  topo/misc/commandline.py: Added warning for when OpenMP is
	  disabled on the commandline due to preceding -g flag
	  (misc/commandline.py).  Updated the documentation to reflect
	  this with a few other minor fixes.

	  parameters to run_batch: timestamp, tag and
	  embed_scriptname.  These parameters will be customised by
	  the dispatch system (WIP) but otherwise the default
	  behaviour should be the same as before.

	* [r12000] topo/command/__init__.py: Reverted my changes in
	  SVN revision 11993 where I added two new parameters to
	  param_formatter in topo.command.  I have decided to
	  implement a custom formatter separately and leave
	  param_formatter with the old (simpler) default

	* [r11995] topo/command/__init__.py: Minor variable name

	  (optional) argument to load_kwargs so an exception can be
	  raised if the file is of invalid format (if desired).

	  (mutable) to avoid use of thread-unsafe use of
	  PyObject_SetAttrString, using LOOKUP_FROM_SLOT_OFFSET

	  to 'Plot in matrix coords', for clarity, and added new 'Plot
	  in sheet coords' right-click option

	  as add(number,simulation time) to be simulation time's type.
	  Allows newer versions of gmpy 1 to work for simulation's
	  time (see
	  http://code.google.com/p/gmpy/issues/detail?id=44).

	* [r11705]

	  OctaveSpectrogramWithAmplification to CochlearSpectrogram
	  and CochlearSpectrogramWithAmplification respectively,

	  like (normalise by non zero count).  Renamed Cochleogram to
	  LyonsCochleogram.

	* [r11698]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Parameter tweaks on DifferenceOfGaussians, SigmoidedDoG,
	  SigmoidedDoLG, PowerSpectrum to make them look pretty in a
	  gui.  Modified spectrogram such that one can define a min &
	  max latency & the available latency range will be rescaled.

	* [r11697]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Changed non zero count method in PowerSpectrum to one

	  doc/Developer_Manual/installation_text.php:
	  Fixed ALERT about build-essential.

2011-07-05 bilal-khan

	* [r11692]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Placed the method convert_to_decibels outside
	  AuditorySpectrogram as it's useful elsewhere.  Corrected
	  AuditorySpectrogram and OctaveSpectrogramWithAmplification,
	  their frequency ranges were counting backwards.  Changed all
	  spectrogram methods to use the new _shape_response method
	  from PowerSpectrum.  Fixed
	  OctaveSpectrogramWithAmplification so it actually works,
	  changed its default amplification to 15%.

	* [r11691]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Removed redundant parameter setting code in PowerSpectrum
	  and TimeSeries.  Corrected a bug in PowerSpectrum where a
	  frequency range [f : f+1] caused a crash.  Added at method
	  to PowerSpectrum called _shape response which provides all
	  subclasses with a minimum overload method to take the
	  frequency decomposition and manipulate it somehow.  Changed
	  Spectrogram to use _shape_response.

	* [r11690]
	  topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Corrected a bug where measuring an auditory frequency
	  preference map would fail for the highest frequency in the
	  sheet.

	* [r11689]
	  topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Created a cleaned up version of PatternPresenter.  Changed
	  frequency and latency presenters to mappers, which is what
	  they really are.  Set their status to abstract to they don't
	  appear in the gui.  Changed frequency and latency
	  measurement commands to use new PatternPresenter and new
	  Mappers.

	* [r11688]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Small formatting cleanup.

2011-07-04 bilal-khan

	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Improved Spectrogram memory efficiency by adding new
	  information in place.

	* [r11673]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Reduced PowerSpectrum's memory load by eliminating one
	  amplitude array.  Reduced PowerSpectrum's computational load
	  by checking to see if the user specified frequency spacing
	  has actually changed before regenerating the range.

	* [r11672]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Removed redundant first_call var in PowerSpectrum.  Changed
	  PowerSpectrum to take advantage of the fact
	  set_matrix_dimensions is called in a PatternGenerator's
	  __init__.  Made amplitudes a class var to save on memory
	  requirements.  Added param labels to LogGaussian.

	* [r11671]
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Added set_matrix_dimensions call to __init__ of
	  PatternGenerator.

2011-07-01 ceball

	* [r11669]
	  topo/transferfn/optimized.py:
	  Use array indexing of active_units_mask and sheet_mask
	  (rather than pointer arithmetic) in
	  CFPOF_DivisiveNormalizeL1_opt.  No measurable impact on
	  performance (for lissom_oo_or,
	  lgn_density=retina_density=48, cortex_density=64, no
	  scheduled actions, 200 iterations).

	* [r11668]
	  topo/learningfn/optimized.py:
	  Use array indexing of output_activity and sheet_mask (rather
	  than pointer arithmetic) in CFPLF_Hebbian_opt.  No
	  measurable impact on performance (for lissom_oo_or,
	  lgn_density=retina_density=48, cortex_density=64, no
	  scheduled actions, 200 iterations).

	* [r11667]
	  topo/transferfn/optimized.py:

	  topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Conflict resolution.

	* [r11643]
	  topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Changed frequency and latency map measurement code to use
	  custom pattern presenters that map the frequency and latency
	  range respectively to the sheet x & y coordinates.

	* [r11641]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Added a description to loadAudioFile explaining the method
	  by which we're rescaling amplitude to the range [0:1].

	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Updated SigmoidedDoLG to use new LogGaussian.

	* [r11627]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Re-parametrised LogGaussian, now uses size, aspect_ratio,
	  x_shape, & y_shape.  Overloaded _call & _setup_xy in
	  LogGaussian to apply scaling & centre the pattern correctly.

	* [r11626]
	  topo/misc/patternfn.py:
	  Changed name of param in log_gaussian (from size to mu).

	* [r11625]
	  topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Added code to measure Onset Latency Preference for auditory
	  models.

	* [r11624]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Corrected bug in AudioFolder where if seconds_per_timestep >
	  interval_length an end of signal value error was raised,
	  even though repeat was turned on.  Corrected bug in
	  audioFolder where the next audio file loaded was not of the
	  correct precision.  Corrected bug in AudioFolder where
	  loading the next audio file occasionally returned an
	  interval smaller than specified.

	* [r11623]
	  param/__init__.py:
	  Corrected bug with Integer param where default=None was not
	  being allowed even when allow_None was set.  Moved bounds
	  checking in Number type into its own method (_checkBounds)
	  to provide a minimum override for _check_value.

	* [r11622]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Changed TimeSeries.sample_rate to Integer type.  Cleaned up
	  some error printing code in TimeSeries.  Added check to make
	  sure interval_start & interval_end in
	  extractSpecificInterval are ints, also changed any functions
	  calling extractSpecificInterval to use ints.  Added new
	  param type TimeSeriesParam.  Changed PowerSpectrum's min and
	  max frequency params to int types.  Removed debug code from
	  PowerSpectrum.

	* [r11621]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Changed error in AudioFile where a file load was attempted
	  before super param initialisation.  Removed
	  AudioFile._extractNextInterval as TimeSeries.__call__
	  obviates the need for it.  Restructured
	  OctaveSpectrogramwithAmplification to remove setParams and
	  incorporate them into __init__.  Added normalization
	  function code to OctaveSpectrogramwithAmplification.  Same
	  thing for LyonsCochlearModel.  Restructured
	  LyonsCochlearModel's __everyCall__ method, incorporating it
	  into _getRowAmplitudes.  Updated Cochleogram accordingly.

	* [r11620]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Small bugfix to previous debug code.

	* [r11619]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Added a tiny bit of debug code to
	  PowerSpectrum._getRowAmplitudes to help track down a weird
	  error with AudioFolder.  Added a normalization_function
	  param to Spectrogram so now each column can be normalized
	  individually.

	* [r11618]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Consolidated PowerSpectrums setParams into its __init__.
	  Simplified PowerSpectrums __firstCall__ accordingly.
	  Modified Spectrogram to use sheet dimensions in preference
	  to the previous spectrograms shape.

	* [r11617]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Set TimeSeries' default time_series & sample_rate to None.
	  The user absolutely must set these as they are intimately
	  linked.  We cannot set them default values just incase the
	  user, on __init__, set's one and not the other.  TimeSeries
	  is only used by other classes, never directly so i think
	  this is fair.  Lastly, TimeSeries will print an informative
	  error if these 2 params are not available.

	* [r11615]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Corrected bug in TimeSeries where a ValueError was raised if
	  the interval_start > interval_end, even though repeat was
	  turned on.  Changed TimeSeries' default signal to be an
	  array of one period of a sine wave from the outset.

	* [r11614]
	  topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Removed cli option -t to display full traceback (full
	  tracebacks are now on by default).

	* [r11613]
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Made output of the full trace on error the default.

	* [r11612]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Incorporated setParams of TimeSeries into its other methods,
	  general restructure & code simplification.  Changed audio
	  methods that inherit from TimeSeries to use the new code.

	* [r11611]
	  param/__init__.py:
	  Changed resolve_path so it now uses a boolean param to
	  determine if the path is to a file or a folder.  Changed
	  Filename and Foldername to use the new param.

	* [r11610]
	  topo/__init__.py:
	  Changed default output path on OS X to be ~/Documents, this
	  is the Mac convention.

	* [r11609]
	  topo/tkgui/__init__.py:
	  Fixes for right click on Mac, now works with keyboard ctrl
	  click, mouse (MagicMouse) right clicks, trackpad
	  (MagicTrackpad) right clicks, and 2 finger touch clicks.

	* [r11608]
	  param/__init__.py:
	  Added a path_type param to resolve_path, changed it from an
	  arg.

	* [r11607]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Corrected indentation errors and missing :'s.

	* [r11606]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Moved TimeSeries to the new Array param type.

	* [r11605]
	  topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Added new commandline option for full trace back.

	* [r11604]
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added new option for full trace back to the console, can be
	  set in the .topographicarc by setting
	  tkgui.topoconsole.display_full_trace = True.

	* [r11603]
	  param/__init__.py:
	  Added new array param type.

	* [r11602]
	  topo/tkgui/__init__.py:
	  Corrected Mac right click button codes.

	* [r11601]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Can now specify the float precision to use for loaded audio
	  data in AudioFile/AudioFolder as a param.  Can now specify
	  float precision to use when calculating ear stage filters in
	  LyonsCochlearModel.  Defaults for both are numpy.float64.

	* [r11599]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Cleaned up imports in audio.  Added new OctaveSpctrogram
	  class where frequency is in base 2 logspace.  Renamed
	  AuditorySpectrogramSimpleOuterEar to
	  OctaveSpectrogramWithAmplification, it now inherits from
	  OctaveSpectrogram.  Simplified frequency spacing
	  calculations in accord with previous changes to
	  PowerSpectrum.

	* [r11598]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Simplified PowerSpectrums _getAmplitudes() method when
	  compressing the frequency range over the sheet dimensions.
	  Changed PowerSpectrums frequency index spacing to be a
	  private param, reduced the number of points it calculates to
	  the sheet dimensions.

	* [r11595]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Changed audiolab file load calls to use float64's instead of
	  float32's.  The documentation used float64's so i imagine we
	  should too.

2011-05-02 ceball

	* [r11590]
	  topo/tests/testFilename.txt:
	  Added test of Filename's search_paths.

	* [r11589]
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Reverted recent change.  Full tracebacks should not be
	  printed to the console.

2011-05-02 bilal-khan

	* [r11588]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Changed Lyons to work in the frequency domain again.
	  Reduced mem requirements by using float32's.

	* [r11587]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Put in sensible default params for SigmoidedDoLG.

	* [r11586]
	  topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Updated rf and frequency pref/selectivity measurement code.

	* [r11585]
	  examples/lissom_audio.ty:
	  Updated lissom_audio to use new pattern generators.

	* [r11582]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Cleaned up imports.  Changed LyonsCochlearModel to inherit
	  from PowerSpectrum instead of PatternGenerator as it now
	  does an FFT, and applys the filters in the frequency domain,
	  then does an iFFT to get back to time domain.  This is the
	  inefficient/lossy way to do it, i will be applying the
	  filters in the time domain as soon as i figure out how to
	  make it work.  Changed the default value for
	  LyonsCochlearModel's signal param to None, this way we won't
	  generate a TimeSeries unless we have to.  Modified
	  Cochleogram to use new LyonsCochlearModel.

	* [r11581]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Bugfixes to TimeSeries parameter checking.  Changes to
	  AudioFolder to bring it in line with AudioFile.

	* [r11580]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Changed AudioFile to correspond to TimeSeries.

	* [r11579]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Corrected parameter checking bugs in TimeSeries.

	* [r11578]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Cleaned up some documentation and fucntion names in
	  PowerSpectrum & TimeSeries.

	* [r11577]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Modified AudioFile to support new TimeSeries architecture.

	* [r11576]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Added a repeat parameter to TimeSeries so the signal can be
	  processed indefinitely.  Incorporated TimeSeries' check
	  param methods into the setParams method.  Changed
	  TimeSeries' generateSineWave method to public.  Moved to
	  firstCall, everyCall structure for TimeSeries.

	* [r11575]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Added __init__ & __firstCall__ methods to both
	  AuditorySpectrogram & AuditorySpectrogramSimpleOuterEar,
	  these simply call their super methods.  Changed some
	  parameter names in AuditorySpectrogramSimpleOuterEar to make
	  things clearer.  Fixed bug in
	  AuditorySpectrogramSimpleOuterEar where all it was
	  outputting was a sheet of nan's - it now works as expected.
	  The only thing still not working right is LyonsCochlearModel
	  as i was attempting to change it from transforming in
	  frequency space to transforming in time space.

	* [r11574]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Added __init__ method to Spectrogram, no idea why/how it was
	  omitted previously, just an oversight.  This shouldn't
	  affect anyone using Spectrogram, only those using a subclass
	  of Spectrogram as the usual call to super __init__ would
	  fail.:

	* [r11573]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Changed AuditorySpectrogram to use new Spectrogram code,
	  changed AuditorySpectrogramWithSimpleOuterEar to
	  AuditorySpectrogramSimpleOuterEar, though note it doesn't
	  actually work.  Neither does LyonsCochlear model, and hence
	  neither does cochleogram.

	* [r11572]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Cleaned up imports, added a check for if the min frequency
	  passed to PowerSpecturm is lower than the max frequency.
	  Combined some split lines into single lines, had too much
	  trouble with line splits, playing it safe from now on.

	* [r11571]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Updated Spectrogram to use new PowerSpectrum.

	* [r11570]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Upgraded PowerSpectrum to cleanly differentiate between
	  first and all other runs.  Changed initialiseWindowParams to
	  setParams, it now validates PowerSpectrum specific params &
	  allows setting of superclass params.

	* [r11569]
	  param/__init__.py:
	  There was an error with the previous implementation of the
	  Foldername param that causes Topographica to crash whenever
	  you try to run *ANYTHING*.  I didn't pick this up on my
	  system because for some reason the .pyc files weren't
	  rebuilt.  It's fixed now.

	* [r11568]
	  osx/xcode3 language references/Install Path.png:
	  Accidentally included a file on last commit, removing in
	  this commit.

	* [r11567]

	  osx/xcode3 language references/Instructions.txt,
	  osx/xcode3 language references/Topographica.xcspec,
	  osx/xcode3 language references/Topographica.xcsynspec:
	  Added files to get automatic syntax colouring for .ty files
	  in Xcode 3.

	* [r11566]
	  examples/lissom_audio.ty:
	  Updates to lissom_audio for compatibility with new methods.

	* [r11565]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Changed AudioFolder to use the new Foldername parameter,
	  removed some debig code from TimeSeries.

	* [r11563]
	  param/__init__.py:
	  Copied the resolve_path class to resolve_path2, a
	  generalised version that checks for the existance of a path
	  and does not discriminate between files and folders.
	  Created 2 new classes resolve_file_path and
	  resolve_folder_path that take the output of resolve_path and
	  simply check if it is a file or a folder respectively.
	  Created a new Path class that is a generalised version of
	  the old Filename class, changed the Filename class to
	  inherit from this new Path class, created a new Foldername
	  class that also inherits from the Path class.  All changes
	  are backwards compatible.

	* [r11562]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Made a rectangular smoothing window default again for
	  PowerSpectrum.  Changed sine wave generation in TimeSeries
	  to wait until an interval is requested before checking if a
	  signal is actually present, no only generate a sine wave in
	  this case.  Changed PowerSpectrum (minor) to fit with this
	  TimeSeries style.  Changed the fft, each run is computed
	  using an entire seconds worth of samples, but instead of
	  filling the difference between the window size and the
	  number of samples per sec with zeros, we tile the signal
	  till it's the right size.

	* [r11561]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Any overrides sent through the Audio methods to the parent
	  class TimeSeries weren't being sent, so TimeSeries would
	  fall back to it's default values for sample_rate etc, this
	  is now fixed.

	* [r11560]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Corrected sine wave generation in TimeSeries so now when you
	  specify a signal length you get the actual length you
	  requested.

	* [r11559]
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Set so the full message/trace is displayed in the GUI on
	  error.

	* [r11558]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Moved sine wave generation inside TimeSeries.  Moved
	  rectangle window inside PowerSpectrum.

	  get_occupied_slots(instance), fixing pickling error for
	  instances of certain classes.

	* [r11551]
	  param/__init__.py:

	* [r11529]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Fixed error message in PowerSpectrum that is displayed when
	  the desired frequency range is unavailable.  Changed
	  TimeSeries default sample_rate to 44100.

	* [r11526]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Corrected bug with LyonsCochlearModel to fit with new
	  TimeSeries.

	* [r11525]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  A new class Cochleogram is to LyonsCochlearModel as
	  Spectrogram is to PowerSpectrum.

	* [r11524]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  A new class LyonsCochlearModel has been implemented to
	  provide a characterisation of cochlear frequency response,
	  think of it as analogous to a PowerSpectrum.  See R.  F.
	  Lyon, 'A computational model of filtering, detection and
	  compression

	* [r11523]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  The simple outer ear amplification effect code that used to
	  be in AudioFolder was moved into a new class
	  AuditorySpectrogramWithSimpleOuterEar, for modularity and
	  mostly because it had nothing to do with AudioFolders.

	* [r11522]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  The auditory specific code (conversion to decibels, octave
	  scales etc) was moved out of Spectrogram in pattern.basic
	  into pattern.audio into the class AuditorySpectrgram (that
	  inherits from Spectrogram).  This provides clean, modular,
	  separation between a power spectrogram and and auditory
	  spectrogram.

	* [r11521]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS CHANGES: Brand new TimeSeries class in
	  pattern.basic, stores any discrete signal and provide
	  operations on it such as extracting a consecutive window of
	  points, Large code restructure of PowerSpectrum and
	  Spectrogram to use the new TimeSeries class (new
	  parametrisation on both these classes, all previous signal
	  parameters are now controlled through the TimeSeries object.
	  Also now we do much more checking for the sanity of
	  arguments, and provide clear error/warning messages if they
	  fail to comply.  Both Spectrgram and PowerSpectrum now
	  automatically partition the requested frequency space into
	  the number of sheet rows so changing sheet density is
	  possible (previously audio sheets had to be fixed at
	  specific densities to correspond to specific frequency/time
	  spaces).  Both PowerSpectrum and Spectrogram can now be
	  instantiated in the GUI as a TimeSeries object initialises
	  with a sine wave by default if no sign is supplied,
	  previously these classes were abstract due to the lack of
	  signal.  NOTE: there seems to be a GUI bug currently
	  preventing these classes actually being instantiated in the
	  Test Pattern window, they work as expected everywhere else).
	  Parameterisation has changed on Diff of Gaussians and
	  Sigmoided Diff of Gaussians to make things
	  simpler/clearer/easier to use.  LogGaussian and Sigmoided
	  diff of LogGaussians now works too, which is to say its
	  earlier erratic behaviour of jumping all over the sheet has
	  been corrected and it's parameters drastically cut down for
	  simplicity/to remove redundant controls.  Audio.py updates
	  equally substantial, included in this commit as they depend
	  heavily on PowerSpectrum and Spectrogram.  AudioFile and
	  AudioFolder have been updated/restructured to use the new
	  TimeSeries object.

	* [r11520]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Changed some internal variable names for audio methods.

	* [r11519]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Improved the way a sine wave is generated for a TimeSeries,
	  corrected the logic so it's actually generated.  Corrected
	  PowerSpectrum to use new TimeSeries.

	* [r11518]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Changed LogGaussian & SigmoidedDoLG to have a default size
	  of 1, a default size of 0 renders a pattern but doesn't make
	  sense conceptually.

	* [r11517]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Changed the way a 10s sin wave is generated when no
	  time_series is set for a TimeSeries object, i have no idea
	  what i was thinking when i wrote the previous method.

	* [r11516]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Corrected rounding a error when calculating the ratio by
	  which the frequency range is compressed to sheet rows.

	* [r11515]
	  osx,
	  osx/Instructions.txt,
	  osx/Launch Topographica.scpt,
	  osx/applet.icns,
	  osx/description.rtfd,
	  osx/description.rtfd/TXT.rtf:
	  Added OS X application building resources.

	* [r11514]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Corrected PowerSpectrum so that it doesn't exclude the
	  bottom of the frequency range anymore.  Also corrected the
	  mapping between the frequency range & sheet rows to take
	  into account the actual number of frequencies per row (on a
	  row by row basis) rather than the average number of
	  frequencies per row - this was causing problems with
	  logarithmic spacing.

	* [r11513]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Changed AudioFolder such that it now uses the new AudioFile,
	  externally the mechanisms are the same, internally it's
	  changes correspond with AudioFile & TimeSeries.

	* [r11512]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Changed AudioFile such that it now inherits from the
	  TimeSeries class (vs Spectrogram).  This has vastly
	  simplified its code such that now all you need to provide is
	  a file path.

	* [r11511]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Updated PowerSpectrum to do a rFFT using a full second's
	  worth of samples, using only those samples in a sample
	  window was resulting in artefacts.  Now we take the sample
	  window and pad with zeros up till the sample rate.

	* [r11510]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Spectrogram has been updated to use the new TimeSeries, &
	  PowerSpectrum classes, crucially this means it is no longer
	  abstract & could be instantiated in a GUI without specifying
	  an audiofile.

	* [r11509]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  PowerSpectrum has been updated to use the new TimeSeries
	  class, crucially this means it is no longer abstract & could
	  be instantiated in a GUI.

	* [r11508]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Added new abstract class TimeSeries to provide a standard
	  object within which we can store any time
	  correlated/sequential data.  If no data is provided the
	  class will generate a 10s sine wave.  This now allows all
	  the auditory methods to be instantiated in the GUI.  Even
	  more importantly the class contains methods to extract part
	  of the series between specified intervals, and can be called
	  to return a self incrementing, sliding window, on the
	  series.

	* [r11507]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Changed rectangular window function from list to numpy
	  array.

	* [r11506]
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Modified LogGaussian pattern removing params for x_tail &
	  y_tail, replaced by a single tail param.  Modified
	  SigmoidedDoLG to use new LogGaussian patter.  Removed
	  DivisiveNormalise output fns from SigmoidedDoLG,
	  SigmoidedDoG, and DifferenceOfGaussians.

	* [r11505]
	  topo/misc/patternfn.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Changed LogGaussian to require only 2 params (x_tail &
	  y_tail) which govern the decay of the gaussian in the
	  respective direction.  Corrected the ability to rotate &
	  scale the pattern, it now behaves like one would expect of
	  the other patterns, lastly the pattern is centred to the
	  middle of the sheet by the peak of the gaussian, there is
	  some debate as to which centering to use (centre of the
	  gaussian as a whole or centre by the position of the peak),
	  i believe centering by the peak to be most appropriate as it
	  is the primary point of interest.

	  doc/Developer_Manual/macinstall_text.php:
	  Build instructions for Topographica on Mac OS X 10.6.* using

	  the python audio lab.

2011-04-02 jbednar

	  SF #3261272).

2011-03-28 jbednar

	* [r11487]

	* [r11477]
	  topo/misc/inlinec.py,
	  topo/responsefn/optimized.py:
	  Integrated Marco's OpenMP changes.  Setting 'openmp=True' in
	  __main__ before inlinec is imported causes OpenMP to be used
	  (similarly to setting 'import_weave' in __main__).  Control
	  over number of OpenMP threads is via 'openmp_threads'

	  contrib/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty:
	  Old-style direction map using four retinas for comparison
	  with lissom_oo_dr.ty, taken from the SVN repository
	  examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty r8657 and updated to work with
	  the current Topographica by running etc/update_094_to_095
	  and etc/update_095_to_096 on it, and then manually
	  correcting the result (which required adding missing
	  brackets to output_fns and changing the explicity output_fn
	  manipulations to output_fns[0].
	
	  Runs but has not been tested for a complete simulation

2011-02-10 ceball

	* [r11441]
	  examples/gcal.ty:
	  Changed GCAL example to use sheet.lissom.LISSOM rather than

	  should be no change, since JointScaling with
	  apply_scaling=False appears to be equivalent to LISSOM.

	  Cleaned up imports in lissom_audio.  Employed standard topo
	  indentation and comment format throughout.  Merged comments
	  and variable names (so to speak) to make code much more

	  lissom_audio to examples.  Marked it as the completed
	  undergrad thesis.

	* [r11426]
	  topo/misc/patternfn.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Added a LogGaussian pattern, this is a 2D Log Gaussian
	  pattern generator allowing standard gaussian patterns but
	  with the added advantage of movable peaks.  Also added a
	  SigmoidedDoLG pattern, this is similar to the SigmoidedDoG
	  pattern but with the afore mentioned advantes of
	  LogGaussian.

	* [r11425]
	  topo/pattern/audio.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Made window params of Spectrogram hidden to users of
	  AudioFile (as per CEBALERT).  Cleaned up imports in
	  pattern/audio.  Copied standard topo indentation and comment
	  format.  Merged comments with variable names (so to speak)
	  in order to make code far more readable.  Optimised code by
	  using standard Python constructs and numpy operations rather
	  than for loops / Java programming style.  Made default
	  params for AudioFile and AudioFolder reasonable (as per
	  JABALERT).

	  the ImportException to the point of use (allows user to learn
	  about possibilties even if he/she is missing an optional module).

	  RawRectangle, added a selectivity as well as preference output

	* [r11017] topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Added ability to multiplicatively amplify a frequency range.
	  Changed AudioFolder to employ AudioFile, previous concat of audio
	  signal behavior does not scale.

	* [r11016] topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Updated AudioFile to use new Spectrogram/PowerSpectrum structure.
	  AudioFile now outputs in dB.

	* [r11015] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Segmented PowerSpectrum for cleaner inheritance, fixed window
	  overlap bug where sample window shrunk instead of overlapping.
	  Updated Spectrogram to use new PowerSpectrum

	* [r11014] topo/pattern/basic.py:

	  work predictably

	* [r11010] topo/misc/patternfn.py:

	* [r11007] topo/base/arrayutil.py:
	  No visible change (renamed internal variable).

	* [r11006] topo/base/arrayutil.py:
	  Simplified array_argmax(). Should be no change to results.

	* [r11005] topo/base/arrayutil.py:
	  Simplified clip_lower() and clip_upper(). New implementation is
	  presumably faster, but I have not verified that. Should be no
	  change to any results.

	* [r11004] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Simpified PatternSampler.__call__() (no longer any need to create
	  'empty' pattern sample in advance). Should be no change to
	  results.

	* [r11003] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Simplified image sampling (also gives vast speedup for presenting
	  images). Should cause no change to results.

2010-03-19  aplebe

	* [r11002] topo/command/key_angles.png:
	  initial static image for angle prefernce map

	* [r11001] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Added preference map for angle between two segments,
	  independently from the
	  segment orientations, and related image with hue coding of the
	  angles

	  Team Members page).

2010-03-15  jbednar

	* [r10999] sounds/sine_waves/ReadMe.txt,
	  sounds/square_waves/ReadMe.txt:
	  Fixed missing newlines

2010-03-14  ceball

	* [r10998] topo/misc/legacy.py:
	  Leagacy support for OneDPowerSpectrum->Spectrogram.

	* [r10997] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Fixed typo (resulting in IPython being unavailable; sf.net bug
	  #2969832).

2010-03-14  bilalkhancnsg

	* [r10996] topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Corrected typo.

	* [r10995] contrib/lissom_audio.ty,
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Added ability for pattern.audio to load a folder of sound files
	  back to back, sample rates must be consistent between files. Can
	  also specify a length of gap to insert between each consecutive
	  sound file. Updated lissom_audio to use new audio load methods.

	* [r10994] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Changed the 'fft results to sheet mapping' so it takes into
	  account ALL amplitudes when drawing on the sheet, this fixes the
	  previous erroneous behaviour where only a tiny subset of
	  amplitudes were employed which caused the bulk of information to
	  be lost, hence distinct bands were seen even on pure tone ffts.
	  It also fixes the problem where the sheet needed normalisation
	  before anything was visible. Lastly it fixes corollary discrete
	  frequency problems since the frequency is now continuous along
	  the sheet (the resolution is directly proportional to the density
	  of the sheet). As a consequence changed lin and logspace mapping
	  such that it now returns all possible frequency indices between
	  user specified min and max (unconstrained by sheet divisions). It
	  also now rounds properly (used to use floor to get int index
	  values). Made some commenting clearer.

	* [r10993] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Added class to measure frequency preference maps in mgb and a1.

2010-03-13  ceball

	* [r10991] Makefile:
	  Fixed bug where system python was being used to create
	  topographica script, rather than Topographica's python. Changed
	  'other python' target to use the 'other python' to create the
	  topographica script.

2010-03-13  bilalkhancnsg

	* [r10990] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Removed the overridden size parameter from LogGaussian.

	* [r10989] topo/misc/patternfn.py:
	  Added a line to sigmoid to explain what is meant by axis.

	* [r10987] sounds/sine_waves/ReadMe.txt,
	  sounds/square_waves/*.wav,
	  sounds/square_waves/ReadMe.txt:
	  Added ReadMe files to the sine and square wave sound file folders
	  explaining the format and how they were generated. Added square
	  waves for each frequency currently in sine waves.

	* [r10985] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Defined a new kind of smoothing window, rectangular, which
	  actually means no smoothing is applied. Set this to be the
	  default.

	* [r10984] topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Changed class name from Spectrogram back to Audio (Audio now
	  inherits from Spectrogram). Removed all spectrogram specific
	  code, retaining only that relevant to the importing of audio
	  files.

	* [r10983] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Moved Spectrogram from topo.pattern.audio to topo.pattern.basic.
	  Spectrogram inherits from new PowerSpectrum, so code content
	  remains largely unchanged, merely restructured to fit the new
	  PowerSpectrum. The changes that have occurred: Spectrogram now
	  pushes new data onto the left side, with older information on the
	  right, and frequencies go from lowest at the bottom to highest at
	  the top - this is how it should have been all along.

	* [r10982] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Renamed class OneDPowerSpectrum to PowerSpectrum. Combined its
	  methods _generate_frequency_indices and _create_indices. Shifted
	  fft calculation into its own function for cleaner inheritance.
	  Commented everything, as a result found and corrected bug where
	  default window parameters were not being overridden in
	  PowerSpectrum.

	* [r10981] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Minor typo correction

2010-03-12  ceball

	* [r10980] external/Makefile:
	  Removed unused variable (was for building via msys on Windows,
	  which does not work).

	* [r10979] MANIFEST.in,
	  Makefile,
	  create_topographica_script.py,
	  setup.py:
	  Fixed some recently introduced bugs in setup.py-related commands.

2010-03-11  jbednar

	* [r10978] topo/misc/patternfn.py:
	  Minor updates and fixes to messages and documentation

	* [r10977] topo/misc/commandline.py,
	  topo/misc/patternfn.py:

2010-03-11  bilalkhancnsg

	* [r10975] contrib/lissom_audio.ty,
	  topo/pattern/audio.py:
	  Modified paths in lissom audio to reflect new sounds folder
	  structure, modified pattern.audio to use a log space for
	  spctrogram.

	* [r10974] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Added class for Sigmoided Difference of Log Gaussians.

	* [r10973] sounds/multipletones,
	  sounds/puretones,
	  sounds/sine_waves,
	  sounds/sine_waves/*.wav,
	  sounds/square_waves,
	  sounds/square_waves/sqr-100Hz.wav,
	  sounds/square_waves/sqr-1kHz.wav:
	  Could not locate the original source to credit for the pure tone
	  sound files so i generated a new one of each. The waveforms of
	  mine appear to be a little cleaner also. Renamed pure tone to
	  sine wave and multiple tone to square wave as this is far
	  clearer.

	* [r10972] topo/misc/patternfn.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Added class for logarithmic gaussian pattern in
	  topo.pattern.basic. Added log_gaussian function to
	  topo.misc.patternfn

	* [r10971] topo/misc/patternfn.py,
	  topo/pattern/audio.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Removed spectrogram code from OneDPowerSpectrum, as the name
	  implies it should only return a one dimensional structure.
	  Spectrogram code is now in pattern/audio. Fft no longer employs a
	  smoothing function (i.e. it operates on a rectangualr window)
	  which produces slightly better results. Moved fft calculation to
	  its own method to make inheritence cleaner. In pattern/audio
	  renamed class Audio to class Spectrogram as this is really what
	  it should have been doing all along (and is now doing). Moved the
	  function aspect of the sigmoid pattern to topo/patternfn as this
	  is conforms to how every other class is doing it.

	* [r10965] setup.py:
	  Uncommented code that was disabled for testing (should have been
	  part of previous commit).

	* [r10964] setup.py:
	  Support easy_install without depending on setuptools.

	* [r10963] Makefile,
	  create_topographica_script.py:
	  Fixed bugs with svnversion variables.

	  sounds/multipletones/sqr-1kHz.wav,
	  sounds/puretones,
	  sounds/puretones/*.wav,
	  sounds/sqr-1kHz.wav,
	  sounds/test.wav:
	  Added 20 sound files of pure tones of ascending frequency ranging
	  from 20Hz to 20000Hz to a folder named 'puretones', added 2 sound
	  files of square waves (test of multiple frequencies) to the
	  'multipletones' folder, and finally, created a folder named
	  'complex' to house the spectral and termporally variant rich test
	  sound (daisy).

	  topo/misc/commandline.py,
	  topo/tests/__init__.py:
	  Allow Topographica to run without gmpy or fixedpoint.

	* [r10957] external/Makefile:
	  fixedpoint-uninstall was leaving files behind.

	* [r10956] MANIFEST.in,
	  Makefile,
	  create_topographica_script.py,
	  setup.py:
	  Simplified distutils pypi commands.

2010-03-06  ceball

	* [r10955] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Made IPython be optional.

	* [r10954] MANIFEST.in:
	  Added missing file.

	* [r10953] MANIFEST.in,
	  Makefile, _setup.py,
	  external/Makefile,
	  setup.py, setup_app.py,
	  setup_exe.py,
	  setup_ez.py:
	  Focus on Python's distutils only: drop setuptools, easy_install,
	  py2exe, and py2app (all of which are incompatible with code in
	  Topographica or at least one of its dependencies in various
	  ways). Also, removed incomplete support for building via MSYS on
	  Windows.

2010-03-03  bilalkhancnsg

	* [r10951] sounds/daisy.wav:
	  Added a new test sound: the song Daisy Bell, this allows us to
	  see how the audio pattern generator holds up to a more complex
	  spectrogram. (Daisy Bell in tribute to the IBM 704 which in 1962
	  became the first ever computer to 'sing')

	* [r10950] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Modified the _feature_list method of class measure_rfs such that
	  it no longer assumes a square sheet

2010-03-02  bilalkhancnsg

2010-03-02  jbednar

	* [r10948] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Cleaned up docstrings

2010-03-02  bilalkhancnsg

	* [r10947] topo/command/basic.py:
	  Added an extra section to the documentation of method
	  pattern_present explaining the back arrow history mechanism
	  availible in the gui to view just presented patterns. Removed the
	  time.sleep command added to pattern_present which attempted to
	  achieve similar functionality.

	* [r10946] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Reverted class Feature to its previous state, the modification of
	  parameter 'range' was duplication of the functionality provided
	  by the parameter 'value'.

	* [r10944] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Changed the name of GammaDistribution to Gamma. Gamma now
	  utilises the SciPy implementation for the generalised gamma
	  distribution. Accordingly much improved the documentation for
	  Gamma.

	* [r10943] topo/misc/patternfn.py:
	  Removed my implementations of gamma and factorial in favour of
	  those from scipy, the scipy versions are one liners so they're
	  now placed directly in topo.pattern.basic where they're utilised.

	* [r10939] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Added a Gamma Distribution class to utilise the gamma function
	  from topo.misc.patternfn. Changed the default x position of
	  SigmoidedDoG from -1.5 to 0. Changed the gaussians such that
	  modifying the global size parameter multiplies the individual
	  size of both.

	* [r10938] topo/misc/patternfn.py:
	  Added new definitions for gamma and recursive factorial (which is
	  employed by gamma). Note that gamma is one dimensional.

	  Cleaned up formatting and docstrings to match Topographica
	  conventions. Should be no change in behavior apart from the

2010-02-10  bilalkhancnsg

	* [r10890] contrib/lissom_audio.ty,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:

	  its weights generator

	* [r10889] contrib/lissom_audio.ty,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  lissom audio sans happyface, and SigmoidedDoG pattern working

	* [r10888] topo/pattern/basic.py:

	* [r10879] contrib/lissom_audio.ty,
	  topo/misc/patternfn.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Added new pattern (Sigmoid) for generating sigmoids along the

2010-02-02  ceball

	* [r10878] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:
	  New Mac buildslave does not yet have necessary tools installed to
	  build docs, so stop warning (it's not a failure of docs to build
	  on Mac). No slow-tests on Windows, because msys shell interacts
	  badly with buildbot, giving false failures.

	* [r10877] doc/buildbot/index.html:
	  Updated links.

2010-02-01  ceball

	* [r10876] param/tk.py:
	  Restored compatibility setting for Tk versions less than 8.5 (for

	* [r10875] external/Makefile:
	  Try to address mysterious, intermittent buildbot error by
	  avoiding pipe in matplotlib unpacking.

	* [r10874] topo/misc/legacy.py:
	  Added legacy support for CFProjection's n_units() method being
	  removed (r10871).

2010-01-31  ceball

	* [r10873] topo/projection/basic.py:
	  Fixed bug in n_bytes() (hadn't been updated after flattening cfs
	  list.

	* [r10872] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/base/projection.py:
	  Minor changes to comments.

	* [r10871] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/sheet/lissom.py:
	  Made CFProjection's n_units() method into an attribute, since the
	  number of units is fixed (should make distribution easier).
	  ResizableCFProjection's n_units is updated when the bounds are
	  changed.

	* [r10870] topo/base/cf.py:
	  CFProjection.n_units() uses the mask template to count the number
	  of units, rather than the mask of the central CF. Should be no
	  change to existing simulations.

	* [r10869] topo/projection/basic.py:
	  Fixed bug where incorrect mask was being stored on shared cf;
	  this resulted in n_units() returning the wrong value (but this
	  had no effect on existing simulations because learning is not
	  implemented for shared weight CFPs).

	* [r10868] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Removed proj from CFIter.

	  topo/learningfn/projfn.py,
	  topo/responsefn/optimized.py,
	  topo/responsefn/projfn.py,
	  topo/transferfn/optimized.py:
	  Use flatcfs and flattened activity array (see svn r10838). Use
	  cf_type stored in CFIter rather than from projection.

	* [r10866] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/learningfn/optimized.py,
	  topo/learningfn/projfn.py:
	  CFPLearningFn.constant_sum_connection_rate() takes n_units
	  directly, rather than proj then accessing proj.n_units(), so that
	  CFIter only needs to store n_units.

	* [r10865] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Made CFIter store activity, flatcfs, and mask (in preparation for
	  it no longer storing the projection).

	* [r10864] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Fixed CFPLearningFn call signature.

	  size

2010-01-15  aplebe

	  Added a check on the cumulative weight value in
	  CFPOF_DivisiveNormalizeL1_opt
	  and CFPOF_DivisiveNormalizeL1, to avoid dividing by 0 - it is
	  especially
	  deceitful for the optimized version, because no error is issued

	* [r10849] contrib/lissom_audio.ty,

	  sounds/sqr-1kHz.wav:
	  1. Connected Cochlea to MGBv with correct edge adjustments,
	  connected MGBv to A1 with correct edge adjustments, put in
	  lateral excitory and inhibitory connections in A1 as in V1, not
	  sure about these entirely at this stage. 2. Sounds can now be
	  placed in the sounds folder and loaded into the file, currently
	  there is a 1kHz square wave and a small drumbeat in there. 3.
	  Cochlea sheet gets populated with the frequency bands (fourier
	  analysis), these are passed up to the MGBv and from there to A1 -
	  i see the patterns of activity pass up but am not sure its 100%
	  correct at this stage (not quite sure how it should look)

	  the internal
	  angle and the control on the intersection points of the two
	  Gaussians. Now it is
	  possible to combina e cross shape, as before, and also a corner
	  shape, with

	  preserve
	  the behaviour of the previous version of the pattern.

2009-07-27  ceball

	* [r10528] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Fix for #1962478 ('Status bar information bug on the map

2009-07-25  ceball

	  Includes some clean-up of the PlotGroup classes. Various parts of
	  plotgroup.py and plot.py still require cleaning, and the GUI's
	  normalization widget placement also needs to be sorted out.

	* [r10523] topo/param/__init__.py:
	  Fix for SF #2661510. (Intermediate checkin: will be cleaned up.

2009-07-23  ceball

	  Added link and hint.

	* [r10521] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Fixed GUI's dynamic coordinates: now there is no systematic
	  offset (SF #2127012), and coordinates work on projection and CF
	  panels (ALERT). Also: changed plot borders to be drawn by tk
	  rather than by us.

	  ipython_view.py from Accerciser and ipythonTk.py from CCP1GUI.
	  ipython_view.py is now part of new IPython releases, so we should
	  just use IPython's version eventaully. (IPython focuses on wx,
	  though, so there is no equivalent of ipythonTk.py in IPython.)

	  restriction of set of GeneratorSheets).

	* [r10492] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Set instantiate=True for pattern_presenter pararameter of
	  SinusoidalMeasureResponseCommand (since it defaults to a mutable
	  object).

2009-07-07  jbednar

	* [r10491] examples/lissom.ty:

	  code from CFProjection and ConnectionField.

	* [r10476] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Added _generate_coords() method to CFProjection, with the

	  coords. Improved simple_vectorize() to handle functions with any
	  number of outputs.

	* [r10475] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added method to get arrays of X and Y sheet coordinates.

	* [r10474] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/projection/basic.py:

	  topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/projection/basic.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Slice no longer stores bounds. Reduces memory usage (as recorded
	  in 'memuse_rSlice_no_bounds.out'). Could increase plotting times
	  - not sure.

	* [r10466] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Corrected an error in CFProjection.change_bounds(): the
	  bounds_template that is stored after changing bounds is now that
	  which corresponds exactly to the slice. Should make no change to
	  any of our simulations, because the correct slice was being
	  passed to the ConnectionField; CFProjection's bounds_template is
	  not currently used by anything after the point it is stored.

	  setup.py, setup_app.py,
	  setup_exe.py,
	  setup_ez.py:

	* [r10348] setup.py,
	  topo/misc/filepath.py,

	  application_path/normalize_path/resolve_path might need to be
	  updated.

	* [r10340] topo/plotting/bitmap.py:
	  Added comment.

	* [r10339] topo/misc/filepath.py:
	  Added 'package_path' (the location of the topo module), which is
	  often what is needed when 'application_path' is currently used.
	  (Some uses of 'application_path' should be 'output_path'.)

	* [r10338] topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py:

	  topo/misc/util.py:
	  More advanced module faking: the fake module is not created until
	  an attempt is made to import the module. So far, only gmpy faking
	  uses this. Should make no visible change to legacy support for
	  gmpy.

	* [r10319] topo/misc/legacy.py:
	  Removed testing code (accidentally left in).

2009-05-28  ceball

	* [r10314] topo/misc/legacy.py:
	  Fixed support for no gmpy.mpq: numbers like '5/7' couldn't be
	  parsed by FixedPoint, so the number is first eval'd (using float
	  division).

	* [r10313] external/gmpy-1.04.tar.gz:

	* [r10134] doc/User_Manual/noise_text.php:
	  Fixed typo

2009-03-08  jbednar

	* [r10133] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Made __setup_xy and __create_and_rotate_coordinate_arrays not be
	  private, because it prevented __call__ from being reimplemented
	  with minor changes in a subclass

2009-03-06  jbednar

	* [r10132] topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_t000100.00_Retinotopy.data:
	  Changed mask_shape to calculate its x, y, and orientation
	  relative to those of the owning pattern, to allow the mask to be
	  offset or a different size from the main pattern. These
	  parameters were previously ignored, and they must now be set to
	  1.0, 1.0, and 0.0 to get the same results as before. Thus it is
	  possible for this change to change results for a pattern using
	  mask_shape, but the old behavior should be easily obtainable by
	  adding parameter settings.

	* [r10131] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py,
	  topo/command/pylabplots.py,
	  topo/misc/legacy.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Added explicit size specification for pattern masks, so that they
	  can later respect their given size

	* [r10130] topo/command/pylabplots.py:
	  Reverted Rectangle to RawRectangle to make tests pass

	* [r10129] doc/News/index_text.php:
	  Added list of new pattern generators, as a comment

	* [r10128] doc/News/index_text.php:
	  Added list of new pattern generators, as a comment

	* [r10127] contrib/lissom_happyface.ty,
	  examples/leaky_lissom_or.ty,
	  topo/analysis/featureresponses.py,
	  topo/command/pylabplots.py,
	  topo/misc/legacy.py,
	  topo/misc/patternfn.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py,
	  topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py:
	  Moved Arc, Curve, and SmoothedRectangle classes into topo/,
	  renaming the old Rectangle class to RawRectangle (possibly to be
	  removed?), and changing SmoothedRectangle to Rectangle. Old code
	  that uses Rectangle will now have a small amount of smoothing by
	  default; to avoid this change Rectangle to RawRectangle in the
	  old code, or set smoothing to zero.

	* [r10126] contrib/lissom_happyface.ty:
	  Major cleanup of documentation, spacing, floating-point errors
	  for parameter values of 0.0, and parameter names. Changed default
	  smoothing values, arc_end to arc_length

	* [r10125] topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/misc/patternfn.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Increased soft bounds on size and aspect_ratio to make working
	  with them in the GUI easier. Added guards for case of zero
	  smoothing, to avoid floating-point errors in extreme cases. Fixes
	  HACKALERT.

2009-03-05  jbednar

	* [r10124] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Added ExponentialDecay pattern.

	* [r10123] examples/gca_lissom.ty,
	  topo/tests/gca_lissom.ty_DATA:
	  Changed y position seed to match lissom_oo_or.ty; will change
	  results

	* [r10122] topo/misc/patternfn.py:
	  Fixed errors in Gabor when aspect_ratio or size was zero

	* [r10121] topo/misc/patternfn.py:
	  Added ExponentialDecay pattern. Fixed errors in Gaussian when
	  aspect_ratio or size was zero

2009-03-04  rczhao

	* [r10120] contrib/lissom_happyface.ty:
	  Replaced Boolean parameter in class Curve with Enumeration.

2009-03-03  ceball

	* [r10119] contrib/rgbhsv.py:
	  File missed from previous checkin (r10118).

	* [r10118] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  Undid changes to ColorImage from 10111. Corrected how mask,
	  scale, offset, output_fns are applied. (Also changed from RGB
	  values on [0,255] to [0,1]; I'd misread the colorsys module
	  documentation.)

2009-03-03  rczhao

	* [r10117] contrib/lissom_happyface.ty:
	  Revised class Curve and function arc_by_center so that Curve can
	  draw both constant-length and constant-width curves.

2009-03-03  jbednar

	* [r10116] topo/tkgui/editor.py:
	  Added import removed in previous revision; was breaking gui-tests

2009-03-03  ceball

	* [r10115] examples/tiny.ty:
	  Fixed list of imports.

2009-03-03  jbednar

	  doc/Developer_Manual/optimization_text.php:

	* [r10113] topo/tkgui/editor.py:
	  Removed duplicate importing of sheets and projections

	* [r10112] examples/gca_lissom.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Fixed area scaling; had not been using the right area or number
	  of inputs for large areas

2009-03-02  ceball

	* [r10111] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  Simplified code for ColorImage by overriding __call__ instead of
	  function().

	* [r10110] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  Fixed ColorImage: scale, offset, mask, and output_fns were not
	  being applied to the color channels.

2009-02-27  ceball

	* [r10109] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  save_plotgroup() now uses Parameterized's set_param() method to
	  set parameters on the plotgroup, thereby giving an error if the
	  wrong name is given for a plotgroup parameter (e.g.
	  save_plotgroup('Activity',normalized=True).

	* [r10108] topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Added set_param() method to Parameterized, for use when setting
	  parameters (instead of setattr(), which does not check for that
	  the named attribute is actually a Parameter).

2009-02-27  jbednar

	* [r10107] examples/gca_lissom.ty:
	  Added support for area parameter

	* [r10106] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:

	* [r10104] contrib/lissom_happyface.ty:
	  Fixed RectangleWithSmoothing to be smoothed in both directions.
	  Changed Arc.arc_end to increase from zero as angles do. Fixed
	  hiding of Curve.arc_end.

2009-02-24  rczhao

	* [r10103] contrib/lissom_happyface.ty:
	  Revised Arc class and rectangle()

2009-02-23  ceball

	  Updated dataset=Gaussian to work with color retina.

	* [r10101] contrib/rgbimages.py,
	  topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Added ListGenerator, to create lists dynamically. Changed
	  ExtendToRGB's channel_strengths to relative_channel_strengths.

	  Added single-file (i.e. color) versions of existing images (the
	  existing images will be deleted in the future).

	* [r10099] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Simplified parentheses.

	* [r10098] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Simplified SheetMask's sheet and data properties by making them
	  both overridable properties. Should be no visible change.

	* [r10097] topo/param/parameterized.py,
	  topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Renamed Oproperty to overridable_property, and cleaned up docs
	  and spacing.

2009-02-23  jbednar

	* [r10096] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  Fixed typo

2009-02-23  ceball

	* [r10095] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Added comment.

	* [r10094] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Fixed error deleting PatternSampler's cache of the image.

	* [r10093] contrib/rgbimages.py,
	  topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Simplified PatternSampler by removing the caching of image array.
	  (The cache no longer appeared to be having much of an impact on
	  performance, since PIL.Image can now be efficiently converted to
	  an array.) Created base class ImageSampler, from which
	  PatternSampler and FastImageSampler (formerly FastPatternSampler)
	  now inherit. Simplified GenericImage's _get_image().

	* [r10092] topo/base/projection.py,
	  topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Added Oproperty, an implementation of 'property' that allows
	  subclasses to override the get/set/del methods.

	* [r10091] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  Updated docs.

	* [r10090] contrib/lissom_rgb.ty:
	  Initial version.

	* [r10089] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  Added ALERT, plus minor cleanup (should be no visible change).

	* [r10088] topo/param/tk.py:
	  Fixed bug with ListWidget where e.g. right clicking on output_fns
	  list in the Test Pattern window caused an error. (The 'disabled'
	  attribute was not being created during __init__.)

2009-02-21  rczhao

	* [r10087] contrib/lissom_happyface.ty:
	  Many improvements.

2009-02-20  ceball

	* [r10086] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  Simplified application of channel_strengths (now applies in both
	  color and monochrome cases.

	* [r10085] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  If ColorImage gets a grayscale image, sets R, G, and B channels
	  to the same (each to 1/3 of grayscale) rather than giving an
	  error.

	* [r10084] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Removed accidentally duplicated line (which I think was having no
	  effect).

	* [r10083] topo/command/analysis.py,
	  topo/command/basic.py,
	  topo/command/pylabplots.py,
	  topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Fixed problem that became apparent in r10076: e.g. p.x=y (where p
	  is a ParamOverrides instance) would be lost when passing on p via
	  **p, because p.x did not result in x being put into the
	  ParamOverrides dictionary (it was only set as an attribute, and
	  hence was lost on converting ParamOverrides to a dictionary via
	  **). ParamOverrides now inserts into its dictionary any attribute
	  that does not start with an underscore. Genuine attributes of
	  ParamOverrides (e.g. extra_keywords) have now been renamed to
	  begin with an underscore (this is better anyway because it
	  reduces the chance for a parameter to have the same name as an
	  attribute of ParamOverrides).

2009-02-19  ceball

	* [r10082] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Added ALERT.

	* [r10081] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  Simplified RotatedHuesImage's random number generation.

	* [r10080] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  ParamOverrides-related renaming for consistency. Should be no
	  visible change.

	* [r10079] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Removed ability to override PatternSampler's parameter when
	  calling it (was unused).

	* [r10078] contrib/rgbimages.py,
	  topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Removed PatternSampler's _initialize_image() method, and made its
	  whole_pattern_output_fns and background_value_fn be constant
	  parameters.

	* [r10077] topo/param/tk.py:
	  Added support to ListWidget for constant List parameters (i.e.
	  don't show a popup menu for a right click if the parameter is
	  constant).

2009-02-19  jbednar

	* [r10076] topo/pattern/basic.py,
	  topo/pattern/random.py,
	  topo/pattern/rds.py:
	  Updated to use cleaner parameter accessing style and to fix cases
	  where parameters supplied in the call to a PatternGenerator
	  instance would be ignored. Should be no change in results except
	  for cases where instances were called with explicit parameters

2009-02-19  ceball

	* [r10075] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  Restored line that went missing sometime recently.

	* [r10074] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Removed unused parameter.

	* [r10073] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Made ParamOverrides-related naming more consistent. Should be no
	  visible change.

	* [r10072] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Some patterns' __call__ methods were ignoring some parameters if
	  they were passed in.

	* [r10071] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Made ParamOverrides-related naming more consistent. Should be no
	  visible change.

	* [r10070] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Minor code simplification.

	* [r10069] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Fixed bug in Constant pattern generator; since output_fn was
	  changed to output_fns, Constant has not been working whenever it
	  has had any output_fns.

	* [r10068] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Made ParamOverrides-related naming more consistent. Should be no
	  visible change.

	* [r10067] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Ensure FileImage's _get_image() uses a filename that's passed
	  into __call__().

2009-02-18  jbednar

	* [r10066] contrib/rgbimages.py:

2009-02-18  ceball

	* [r10064] topo/sheet/basic.py:

	* [r10063] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Added commented-out code for measuring hue maps with a single
	  color retina.

	* [r10062] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  More simplification. Should be no visible change.

	* [r10061] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  Simplified ColorImageSheet: automatically wraps input_generator
	  in ExtendToRGB.

	* [r10060] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  More renaming of variables.

	* [r10059] contrib/rgbimages.py,
	  topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Various RGB-related renaming and documentation.

	* [r10058] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  Simplified ColorImage after recent changes to GenericImage.

	* [r10057] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Made PatternSampler's __call__ not change the supplied x and y
	  matrices. (Changing the supplied x any matrices prevents their
	  reuse e.g. in a subclass of GenericImage that makes more than one
	  sample.)

	* [r10056] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Reverted change accidentally introduced during recent
	  reorganization.

	* [r10055] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Added to comment.

2009-02-18  ceball

	* [r10050] topo/pattern/image.py,
	  topo/tests/testimage.py:
	  Simplified GenericImage and PatternSampler by removing duplicate
	  parameters size_normalization and whole_image_output_fns from
	  GenericImage.

	* [r10049] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Intermediate checkin: changing GenericImage to have a
	  PatternSampler instance, rather than creating one from a type
	  each time. Should simplify code and cut down on parameter
	  duplication.

	* [r10048] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Removed redundant check.

	  changed at once. Simulations using Gaussian input patterns will
	  now have different results (differences should be insignificant)
	  because the input seeds have changed in that case.

	  stream of x, y, and orientation). Although simulation results
	  will change, they should not be different in any significant way.

2009-01-15  jbednar

	  Fixed confusing attribute name

	* [r9766] topo/base/sheetview.py,

	  Changed to use global_params instead of locals().

	* [r9751] topo/command/basic.py:
	  Converted run_batch() to use global_params. Should be no change
	  for current users of run_batch(), except that warnings will be

	  adding gc_allissom

2009-01-07  ceball

	* [r9746] topo/misc/legacy.py:
	  Added support for SineGratingDisk, SineGratingRectangle, and
	  SineGratingRing. Removed broken support for

	  Added docstring.

	* [r9744]

	  duplicate values are specified, and keep track of parameter names
	  so that unused parameters can be detected.

2009-01-04  ceball

	  Added method to Parameterized allowing new Parameter objects to
	  be installed into a Parameterized class.

	  ParameterizedMetaclass: moved parameter initialization
	  (inheritance, attribute name setting) into a separate method.
	  Should be no visible change.

2009-01-03  ceball

	* [r9736] topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  When instantiating Parameters, avoid redundantly instantiating
	  objects from superclasses.

	* [r9735] topo/param/parameterized.py,
	  topo/tests/testparameterizedobject.py:
	  Fixed inheritance for Parameter's instantiate slot (SF #2483932).

2008-12-31  ceball

	* [r9730] external/Makefile,
	  external/line_profiler-582df342463a.tar.gz:
	  Added line_profiler, for line-by-line profiling. From
	  http://www.enthought.com/~rkern/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/line_profiler/

	* [r9729] external/Cython-0.9.8.1.1.tar.gz,
	  external/Makefile:
	  Added Cython 0.9.8.1.1 from cython.org.

2008-12-27  ceball

	* [r9728] external/Imaging.diff,
	  external/Makefile:
	  Removed PIL patch that is no longer required (at least, it isn't
	  required on Sake).

2008-12-21  ceball

	* [r9727] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  Use multiple input images in example.

	* [r9726] topo/command/analysis.py:

	  topo/command/analysis.py,
	  topo/command/pylabplots.py,
	  topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Added row_precedence to Sheet, to allow grouping before
	  precedence is applied. (Handling of parameters by SheetView etc
	  needs to be cleaned up; this change just copies previous code in
	  that respect.)

2008-12-20  ceball

	* [r9721] external/Makefile,
	  external/Tkinter_bool_none.diff,
	  topo/param/tk.py:
	  GUI: Added support for None in boolean variables.

	* [r9720] topo/param/parameterized.py,
	  topo/param/tk.py:
	  Made GUI use script_repr() rather than repr() for displaying
	  ordinary Parameters. Currently has the side effect that full
	  paths are displayed (e.g.
	  'topo.command.analysis.update_command()' rather than just
	  'update_command()').

	* [r9719] topo/param/tk.py:
	  Added parameter to control whether or not labels are displayed on
	  ParametersFrames.

2008-12-19  jbednar

	  Added note about faking SineGratingDisk

	* [r9714] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py,
	  topo/command/pylabplots.py,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Added new, simpler OrientationContrast pattern, and changed
	  clients of OrientationContrastPattern to use it instead.

	* [r9713] topo/command/pylabplots.py,
	  topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_t000100.00_Retinotopy.data:
	  Changed SineGratingRectangle to
	  SineGrating(mask_shape=Rectangle()). Updated saved Retinotopy
	  data array; plot hasn't visibly changed, but apparently the
	  underlying matrix values differ.

	* [r9712] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Replaced SineGratingDisk with SineGrating(mask_shape=Disk())

	* [r9711] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Changed pattern mask to be applied before scaling and offset, to
	  allow mask to be used to set the shape but otherwise leave the
	  pattern acting like other patterns.

	* [r9710]
	  contrib/lissom_oo_or_species_tracked.ty,
	  contrib/species_cf_jitter.ty,
	  contrib/species_lateral_sparsity.ty,
	  topo/analysis/featureresponses.py,
	  topo/command/pylabplots.py,
	  topo/pattern/teststimuli.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editor.py:
	  Fixed 'centre' to be 'center' to make spelling consistent

	* [r9709]
	  contrib/lissom_oo_or_homeostatic_tracked_new.ty:
	  Fixed typo

2008-12-19  ceball

	* [r9708] external/Makefile:
	  Enabled patch to address SF #2119256 (32-bit/64-bit machines &
	  snapshots).

	* [r9707] external/Makefile,
	  external/Python_64bit_pickle.diff:
	  Added commented-out patch to Python to address problem loading
	  32-bit pickles on 64-bit machines (and vice versa).

2008-12-18  antolikjan

	  minor changes

2008-12-18  jbednar

	* [r9703] topo/command/pylabplots.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Moved implementation of FFT plots out of the GUI and into
	  pytlabplots, to make it possible to call in batch mode. Fixed
	  parameter passing for gradientplots, for the same reason.

2008-12-17  antolikjan

	* [r9702] topo/analysis/vision.py:
	  removed default parameters from measure_and_analyze_complexity
	  measure_or_pref call

2008-12-17  ceball

	* [r9701] external:
	  Updated svn:ignore.

	* [r9699] external/Imaging-1.1.5.tgz,
	  external/Imaging-1.1.6.tgz,
	  external/Makefile:

	  PIL 1.1.6.

2008-12-16  ceball

	* [r9697] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Fixed bug introduced in r9682 (when I fixed the bug where scale
	  was varying when there was no OD, I inadvertently removed the
	  'scalingfactors' for natural images).

	* [r9696] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Altered Selector's get_current_generator() so that it does not
	  cause the index to advance.

2008-12-16  antolikjan

	  contrib/lissom_oo_or_homeostatic_tracked_new.ty:
	  minor changes

	  Commented out some things and also change lr_x_avg to x_avg

	* [r9692] topo/sheet/lissom.py:
	  Made it possible to switch off scaling with parameter

2008-12-15  ceball

	* [r9691] contrib/rgbimages.py:
	  Initial sketch of RGB image support; work in progress.

	  Removed _create_pattern_sampler() (should be no visible change).

	* [r9688] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Removed apparently unused method.

	* [r9687] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Renamed __setup_pattern_sampler() to _create_pattern_sampler()
	  (so it can be used by subclasses).

2008-12-15  antolikjan

	* [r9686] contrib/cc_lissom_oo_or_simple_rv.ty:
	  minor parameter changes

	  changed the activity histogram measurement

2008-12-12  ceball

	* [r9682] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Fixed input pattern scale where 'od' not in dims (SF #2413540).

2008-12-11  chrisjeffery

	* [r9681] contrib/lissom.ty:
	  added new direction map measurement, which is not working. Also
	  added changes from examples/lissom.ty for preference maps.

2008-12-10  antolikjan

	* [r9680]
	  contrib/gc_lissom_oo_or_homeostatic_new.ty:
	  enlarged LGN and Retina to get rid of edge effects

2008-12-10  ceball

	* [r9679] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Adjusted parameters to match lissom.ty dims=or,dr.

2008-12-09  antolikjan

	* [r9678] contrib/cc_lissom_oo_or_simple_rv.ty:
	  added simple linear homeostatic control

2008-12-09  chrisjeffery

	* [r9677] contrib/lissom.ty:
	  Forked lissom.ty for separate development of new dr model.
	  Currently broken, just checking in to keep track of changes.
	  Removed multiple sheets for direction, and changed connections to
	  use staggered delays. Inputs are not set up correctly yet.

2008-12-08  jbednar

	* [r9676] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Updated combined plots definitions to match recent changes in
	  topo.command.

	* [r9675] topo/command/pylabplots.py:
	  Made overlaid_plots arguments into documented Parameters.

2008-12-08  ceball

	* [r9674] topo/param/tk.py:
	  More simplification of param.tk.Menu. Should be no visible
	  change.

	* [r9673] topo/param/tk.py:
	  Should be no visible change: updated documentation of
	  param.tk.Menu

	* [r9672] topo/param/tk.py:
	  Fixed SF #2406957 (right-click menus broken).

2008-12-08  antolikjan

	* [r9671] contrib/cc_lissom_oo_or_simple_rv.ty:
	  Made some consolidation/simplification of the code

2008-12-08  jbednar

2008-12-05  jbednar

	* [r9667] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py,
	  topo/command/pylabplots.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Changed update_command and plot_command into HookLists, now
	  requiring lists rather than commands or strings. Changed passing
	  of sheet, input_sheet, projection, and coords arguments to be
	  done by calling the instance with those values, rather than the
	  previous indirect, complicated, and error-prone method of setting
	  various class attributes. Changed default_measureable_sheet and
	  default_input_sheet to be calculated in the plotgroup rather than
	  separately in the update_command and plot_command (with the
	  accompanying difficulty making the values match).

2008-12-05  antolikjan

	* [r9666] contrib/jacommands.py:
	  SimpleHomeoLinearRelative

2008-12-05  jbednar

2008-12-04  ceball

	* [r9657] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty,
	  topo/analysis/featureresponses.py,
	  topo/command/basic.py:
	  Added direction map measurement for new motion model.

2008-12-04  jbednar

	* [r9656] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added support for plot_command lists

	* [r9655] topo/command/analysis.py,
	  topo/command/pylabplots.py,
	  topo/tests/gui_tests.py,
	  topo/tests/test_map_measurement.py:
	  Moved all plots requiring MatPlotLib to pylabplots.py, so that
	  they can switch plot_command from strings to actual commands
	  (which much thus have all imports be available). Should not
	  change behavior at all.

	* [r9654] doc/User_Manual/commandline_text.php:
	  Minor update to example

	* [r9653] contrib/lesi_whisker_barrels.ty,
	  examples/lissom.ty,
	  examples/lissom_whisker_barrels.ty,
	  topo/analysis/featureresponses.py,
	  topo/analysis/vision.py,
	  topo/command/analysis.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/gui_tests.py:
	  Changed ParameterizedFunction update_commands to use .instance()
	  to allow flexible handling of their parameters. Changed plot
	  update_commands into lists, to allow them to be declared as type
	  HookList and to provide a simple [] empty default. Cleaned up
	  PatternPresenter warnings to avoid overwhelming output.

	* [r9652] doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php:
	  Minor clarification

2008-12-04  ceball

	* [r9651] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Moved Translator(PatternGenerator) to topo.pattern.basic.

2008-12-03  ceball

	* [r9650] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Initial version of ocular preference overlaid with hue preference
	  boundaries.

	* [r9649] examples/lissom.ty,
	  topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Moved combined plots to lissom.ty; script selects appropriate
	  combinations (depending on dims).

2008-12-02  ceball

	* [r9648] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added method to allow Plots menu to be refreshed.

	* [r9647] topo/param/tk.py:
	  param.tk.Menu: fixed deletion of a range.

	* [r9646] topo/param/tk.py:
	  Cleaned up tk.param.Menu (simplified code and fixed deletion of
	  items).

	* [r9645] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Change missed from r9644.

	* [r9644] topo/param/tk.py:
	  tk.param.Menu: Renamed 'entries' to 'named_commands'; Menu now
	  only stores commands in named_commands if they are actually
	  named.

	* [r9643] topo/param/tk.py:
	  Change missed from r9641 (insert() now adds the index as a
	  string).

	* [r9642] topo/param/tk.py:
	  param.tk.Menu: fixed delete() method, which removed the internal
	  index before actually deleting the associated menu item.

	* [r9641] topo/param/tk.py:
	  Made param.tk.Menu's internal indexing more consistent (if an
	  index has no name associated with it, its string representation
	  is used as a key in the internal name-index dictionary, to match
	  how named items are stored). Should have no visible impact.

	* [r9640] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Topoconsole now alphabetically sorts Plot submenu items.

2008-12-01  ceball

	* [r9639] topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Fixed ParameterizedFunction's __reduce__ (was resulting in
	  reconstructed instances reverting to ParameterizedFunctions,
	  instead of whatever subclass they were).

2008-12-01  antolikjan

	* [r9638] contrib/sparse_connectivity_model.ty:
	  Made few parameters external

	* [r9637]
	  contrib/gc_lissom_oo_or_homeostatic_new.ty:
	  Made few parameters external

2008-11-29  ceball

	* [r9636] topo/plotting/bitmap.py:
	  Minor simplification: should be no visible change.

	* [r9635] topo/misc/filepath.py:
	  Made resolve_path() raise an error if a file is not found when an
	  absolute path is supplied (it already raises an error when an
	  unfound relative path is supplied, so now it is more consistent).

	* [r9634] doc/User_Manual/batch_text.php:
	  Fixed reference.

2008-11-27  rczhao

	* [r9633] /trunk/facespace/fs1mf.ty:
	  Added measure_or_in_face function

2008-11-25  ceball

	* [r9625] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Corrected mistake in docstring, introduced when I added the
	  'colormap' label.

	* [r9624] topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Added commented-out __deepcopy__ method for Parameterized.

	* [r9623] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  Removed redundant method.

	* [r9622] topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Clarified comment.

	* [r9621] topo/command/basic.py,
	  topo/misc/util.py:
	  Files accidentally missed from previous commit.

	* [r9620] topo/misc/legacy.py:
	  Removed ExtraPickler. Includes no longer restoring things that
	  had been held in ExtraPickler (I assume that was only
	  topo.plotting.plotgroups).

	* [r9619] topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Should be no visible change: changed ParameterizedFunction's
	  _true_new() to use Parameterized.__new__ rather than
	  object.__new__, and allowed args to be passed to _true_new when
	  creating an instance.

	* [r9618] topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Fix bug with ParameterizedFunction: control copy/pickle's use of
	  __new__ (avoids calling instance when trying to recreate it).

	* [r9617] topo/misc/filepath.py:
	  Fixed warning message that hadn't been updated (Parameter's
	  attrib_name() method was removed some time ago).

	* [r9616] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py,
	  topo/command/basic.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Changed Subplotting to keep track of last arguments and restore
	  them on load_snapshot. Removed pickling of plotgroups, which
	  should no longer be necessary (and was causing many problems).

	* [r9615] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Added commented-out examples of generating complete list of
	  combinations in measure_sine_pref

	* [r9614] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Added direction and speed to the list of features supported by
	  measure_sine_pref

	* [r9613] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Changed PatternGenerator to use given ocular and phasedisparity
	  rather than relying on them being set on the input generators

	* [r9612] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Added phase property to Sweeper for use in measure_sine_pref.

2008-11-20  jbednar

	* [r9611] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Fixed bug in orientation maps measured using measure_dr_pref by
	  adding round(x,13) to compute_orientation_from_direction so that
	  wrapped orientations have exactly the same value. Previously the
	  OR map was heavily biased towards 0.5/pi, because one wrapped
	  value was nearly but not identical to the unwrapped one. Usually
	  that would have no effect on a vector sum, but with
	  keep_peak=True, the result is to weight the duplicated value
	  twice as strongly, pulling all values towards it. Made
	  num_speeds=0 legal to allow strict comparison between
	  measure_sine_pref and measure_dr_pref.

	* [r9610] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Cleaned up present_permutation; no change in behavior. Added
	  optional offset for a Feature. Relaxed direction handling in
	  PatternPresenter so that it will work on any network, at speed 0.

	* [r9609] topo/misc/distribution.py:
	  Added bins() method

	* [r9608] images/colormap/rgb/11_0.pgm:
	  Fixed stray uncommitted change

2008-11-19  ceball

	* [r9607] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Added dataset label 'colormap' to distinguish from Nature
	  (Shouval) images. (Need a better label than 'colormap'.)

	* [r9605] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py,
	  topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Added mechanism for computing feature values from other permuted
	  ones, and added computed orientation map for measure_dr_pref

2008-11-18  jbednar

	* [r9604] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Changed order of map measurement to make subplotting work and to
	  ensure that the best versions of each map are used. Made
	  expand_sf_test_range optional and off by default, for speed.
	  Removed disparity and hue testing from measure_sine_pref command,
	  to avoid combinatorial explosion.

	* [r9603] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Added more informative messages for save_plotgroup in batch mode.
	  Changed measure_disparity to use a vertical test pattern, for
	  speed, rather than being part of measure_sine_pref.

	* [r9602] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Added more informative messages in batch mode. Fixed passing of
	  parameters by keyword for FeatureMaps (name, in this case)

2008-11-18  ceball

	* [r9601] topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Simplified ParameterizedFunction.instance(), and corrected naming
	  of class object.

	* [r9600] topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Added instance() to ParameterizedFunction.

2008-11-17  jbednar

	* [r9599] topo/command/pylabplots.py:
	  Removed unused plotrctg command. Removed unused extra_keyword
	  support from plot_modulation_ratio

	* [r9598] topo/command/basic.py:
	  Enabled result caching for plots; should give significant speedup
	  for lissom.ty

	* [r9597] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Finished save_plotgroup update_command caching support; should be
	  safe to use now (though it is not turned on by default).

	* [r9596] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Changed most update_commands to callable objects rather than
	  strings, to allow parameters to be edited in the GUI.

2008-11-17  ceball

	* [r9595] topo/misc/picklemain.py:
	  Removed stray line from previous checkin.

	* [r9594] topo/command/basic.py,
	  topo/misc/picklemain.py,
	  topo/misc/util.py:
	  Moved MainPickler and associated code into a new module,
	  topo.misc.picklemain.

2008-11-17  jbednar

	* [r9593] topo/command/analysis.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Removed proj_name<->projection conversion from
	  UnitMeasurementCommands, to simplify it and ensure that
	  everything is done via Parameters rather than ad-hoc attributes

2008-11-17  ceball

	* [r9592] topo/command/basic.py,
	  topo/misc/util.py,
	  topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Added support for pickling functions and classes defined in
	  __main__.

2008-11-16  ceball

	* [r9591] examples/cfsom_or.ty:
	  Restored cfsom_or's results to previous values (they had changed
	  in r9582) by explicitly setting parameters of the connection's
	  weights_generator, rather than relying on defaults (which had
	  changed).

	* [r9590] topo/pattern/image.py:
	  Fix for SF #2276819: loading snapshots of simulations using
	  FileImage now works.

2008-11-16  jbednar

	* [r9589] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/test_map_measurement.py:
	  Added support for update_command and plot_command that are
	  callable objects rather than strings for exec. For now, this
	  changes the representation in the GUI to include quotation marks,
	  but these should go away as we change the various commands to
	  objects rather than strings

2008-11-15  jbednar

	* [r9588] topo/command/analysis.py,
	  topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_t000100.00_Spatial_Frequency_Preference.data:
	  Changed default spatial frequency preference plot to test only
	  one frequency, primarily for speed but also to avoid enforcing
	  special defaults that are more difficult for .ty scripts to
	  override

	* [r9587] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Added support for measure_sine_pref

	* [r9586] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Converted save_plotgroup to a ParameterizedFunction, adding
	  experimental use_cached_results option (disabled by default).
	  Added comprehensive measure_sine_pref command, which should
	  eventually replace measure_or_pref, measure_od_pref,
	  measure_phasedisparity, measure_hue_pref, etc.

2008-11-14  jbednar

	* [r9585] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Minor tweaks; should be no change in normal behavior

2008-11-14  ceball

	* [r9584] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Translator: Implemented episode intervals.

	* [r9583] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Translator: simplified 'last_time' and calls to float().

2008-11-14  jbednar

	* [r9582] topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Changed default size and aspect_ratio of Gaussian to avoid
	  confusion -- pattern looked vertical but had an actual
	  orientation of 0.

	* [r9581] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Cleaned up docs, parameter names, defaults, etc. for Translator.
	  Fixed self references that should have been p.

	* [r9580] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Translator: when drawing underlying pattern, uses that pattern's
	  parameters to offset the pattern's position or rotate the
	  pattern's orientation.

	* [r9579] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  x, y, and direction are now set on the Translator itself.

	* [r9578] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Translator: moved orientation parameter back to generator, to be
	  consistent with x and y (which are also on the generator).

	* [r9577] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Minor changes to Translator (no visible change).

	* [r9576] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Changed Translator.__call__ to use ParamOverrides.

	* [r9575] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty,
	  topo/pattern/basic.py:
	  Continued cleaning up Translator. Should be no change to
	  behavior, although the random stream might be being used
	  differently.

	* [r9574] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Added missing svn properties.

	* [r9573] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Translator: commented out more unused code, altered some
	  documentation, and added some commented-out parameters. No change
	  to the behavior.

	* [r9572] topo/projection/basic.py:
	  Changed SharedWeightCFProjection to handle creation of CF slices
	  in the same way as CFProjection. (Intermediate checkin: I'm
	  planning to reorganize the CF hierarchy; meanwhile, this should
	  improve start times dominated by creation of
	  SharedWeightCFProjections.)

2008-11-13  jbednar

	* [r9571] topo/command/basic.py:
	  Added plot measurement at time zero

	* [r9570] contrib/lissom_oo_or_homeostatic.ty:
	  Made frequency scaling and target_lr be automatic for each
	  dataset. Changed Natural dataset to Nature, to match the CMVC
	  book. Added error in case of no dataset specified

2008-11-13  ceball

	* [r9569] topo/misc/legacy.py,
	  topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  No visible change: removed stray print statement and added an
	  ALERT.

	* [r9568] topo/misc/legacy.py:
	  Support missing allow_None in old snapshots: addresses SF
	  #2270680. Snapshots saved before allow_None was added to
	  Parameters will be loaded with allow_None set to False in all
	  cases.

	* [r9567] topo/misc/legacy.py:
	  Upgraded preprocess_state() to allow more operations (by having
	  functions also accept the instance they are working on).

	* [r9566] topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Tried to clarify warning message about restoring class
	  attributes.

	* [r9565] topo/misc/legacy.py:
	  Snapshot compatibility: Made replacement of gmpy.mpq by
	  fixedpoint.FixedPoint only happen if gmpy.mpq is not available.

2008-11-12  ceball

	* [r9564] topo/misc/legacy.py:
	  Added support for loading snapshots when gmpy.mpq is not present
	  (SF #2221332).

	* [r9563] topo/misc/legacy.py:
	  Changed fake_a_module() so that parent can be None.

2008-11-12  judelaw

	* [r9562] topo/command/pylabplots.py:
	  corrected error in plot_tracked_attributes - changed filename to
	  p.filename

	* [r9561] contrib/jsldefs.py:
	  corrected error and brought up to date with current version

2008-11-10  jbednar

	* [r9560] contrib/jaanalysis.py,
	  contrib/jacommands.py,
	  contrib/jsldefs.py,
	  contrib/modelfit.py:
	  Updated contrib files to match changes in pylabplots

	* [r9559] topo/command/pylabplots.py:
	  Added typical defaults for attribute tracking times

	* [r9558] topo/command/analysis.py,
	  topo/command/pylabplots.py:
	  Removed now-unneeded matrixplot_hsv

	* [r9557] topo/command/pylabplots.py:
	  Converted remaining pylab commands to ParameterizedFunctions
	  using PylabPlotCommand. The order of arguments accepted will have
	  changed, but it should be rare that a positional argument is used
	  beyond the first two, and those have been preserved. All but
	  plot_tracked_attributes have been tested for basic function, but
	  there are few automatic tests for these commands, and thus there
	  may be some new bugs.

	* [r9556] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Updated to use new tuning curve commands; should not change any
	  results relative to previous version

	* [r9555] topo/command/pylabplots.py:
	  Added tuning curve implementation using ParameterizedFunction;
	  will allow significant simplification and generalization, but the
	  old version is still in the file (as tuning_curve_old and
	  or_tuning_curve, replaced by tuning_curve and
	  cyclic_tuning_curve) for comparison. The old tuning_curve and
	  or_tuning_curve commands have been generalized as well, as an
	  intermediate step, to eliminate the need for tuning_curve_batch
	  and or_tuning_curve_batch. The only change to results should be
	  that the x axis will no longer have a gap on the last item for
	  tuning_curve plots, which changes the tick marks (but not the
	  quantities plotted).

2008-11-08  ceball

	* [r9554] contrib/lesi_whisker_barrels.ty:
	  Attempt to correct svn:keywords on
	  contrib/lesi_whisker_barrels.ty.

2008-11-07  jbednar

	* [r9553] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:

2008-11-07  ceball

	* [r9552] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Inserted a modified version of contrib.jacommands.Translator
	  (fixed faulty initial reset period; removed Null() every
	  reset_period; removed index parameter and associated code). Work
	  in progress.

2008-11-07  jbednar

	  Initial version from Stuart with fixes for the latest version of
	  Topographica

	* [r9548] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Partial update to use a single retina and LGN ON/OFF pair instead
	  of four of each of those; seems to work but the pattern generator
	  will need to be updated to present inputs moving over time

	* [r9547] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Added missing import

2008-11-04  rczhao

	* [r9546] /trunk/facespace/fs1mf.ty:
	  Merged with ~/.topographicarc so that simulation of face space
	  doesn't need specific startup files.

	* [r9545] /trunk/facespace/pattern_fs.py:
	  minor update

2008-11-02  ceball

	* [r9544] topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Parameterized classes now have a name attribute (set to the class
	  __name__).

2008-10-31  jbednar

	* [r9543] topo/command/pylabplots.py:
	  Made Orientation Preference and Complexity possible to use with
	  networks other than contrib/cc_*, but it still needs significant
	  generalization. Removed duplication of suffix in saved pylab
	  filenames.

	* [r9542] topo/analysis/vision.py:
	  Made Orientation Preference and Complexity possible to use with
	  networks other than contrib/cc_*, but it still needs significant
	  generalization. Removed duplication of suffix in saved pylab
	  filenames.

	* [r9541]
	  contrib/sparese_connectivity_model.ty:
	  Fixed filename

	* [r9540]

	  Added annotation (for r9395) to buildbot graph.

	* [r9536] doc/buildbot/bbanalysis.py:
	  Updated buildbot analysis script (had previously been running on
	  an old copy of Topographica).

	* [r9535] doc/buildbot/bbanalysis.py:
	  Fixed typo in buildbot analysis script.

	* [r9534] topo/tests/gui_tests.py:
	  Fixed failing Test Pattern window test. (Correct fix would be to
	  stop None appearing from sheet lists in GUI; we hope to do this
	  soon.)

	* [r9533] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Fixed copy/paste error from r9521.

2008-10-28  antolikjan

	* [r9532]

	  Initialization of the face database

	* [r9526] /trunk/facespace/evofacemodel:
	  MATLAB codes that generates faces from Evo-Face model database.
	  Note that the database and some original codes are not included
	  in this public repository.

2008-10-24  jbednar

	* [r9525] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Minor expansion of doc

	* [r9524] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Rearranged all of the plot definitions for readability and in
	  preparation for making update_command into a callable rather than
	  a string, hopefully without changing anything at all

	* [r9523] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty,
	  examples/lissom.ty,

	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Renamed ParameterizdFunction abstract base classes for commands
	  to end in Command rather than Function, for clarity

	* [r9522] contrib/jaanalysis.py,
	  contrib/jacommands.py,
	  contrib/jsldefs.py,
	  contrib/lesi.ty,

	  generality

	* [r9518] topo/command/analysis.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Removed now-unused module-level interface to command parameter
	  defaults

2008-10-24  antolikjan

	* [r9517]
	  contrib/sparese_connectivity_LESIE.ty:
	  Made more parameters to be modifiable from command line

2008-10-24  jbednar

	* [r9516] topo/command/analysis.py,
	  topo/command/pylabplots.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Changed sheet_name and input_sheet name parameters to sheet and
	  input_sheet, so that they could have defaults computed and then
	  shared appropriately.

	* [r9515] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Added UnitCurveFunction to group FeatureCurveFunctions that work
	  on a set of units

2008-10-24  rczhao

	* [r9514] /trunk/facespace/pattern_fs.py:
	  A simpler face generator to replace face-space.ty; currently only
	  implemented a class dealing with one-dimensional face space with
	  data from external MATLAB database

2008-10-24  ceball

	* [r9513] topo/param/__init__.py:
	  Corrected error introduced into get_range() in previous checkin.

2008-10-24  rczhao

	  A simpler face space script to replace face-space.ty; deals with
	  one-dimensional face space only and get data from external MATLAB
	  database

2008-10-24  ceball

	* [r9511] topo/param/__init__.py:
	  Added compute_default() method to ObjectSelector.

	* [r9510] topo/param/__init__.py:
	  ObjectSelector now ensures that the default value is in its list
	  of objects.

	* [r9509] topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Added optional name argument to params(), so that one parameter
	  object can be requested.

	* [r9508] topo/param/__init__.py:
	  ObjectSelector now defaults to having instantiate=False, which
	  makes more sense because we usually use it to select from a list
	  of existing objects.

2008-10-24  jbednar

	* [r9507] topo/command/analysis.py,
	  topo/command/basic.py,

	  that it works for any parameter. (Many changes come from changing
	  various methods to 'protected' rather than 'private'.)

2008-10-23  jbednar

	* [r9500] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Made measure_orientation_contrast into a ParameterizedFunction.

	* [r9499] topo/param/parameterized.py:

	  now also initialized. Fixes problem with missing name.

2008-10-23  jbednar

	* [r9494] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Added control over curve value printing format. Converted
	  measure_contrast_response to a ParameterizedFunction.

	* [r9493] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Simplified and generalized curve implementation. Updated
	  docstrings. Converted measure_size_response to a
	  ParameterizedFunction.

2008-10-23  antolikjan

	* [r9492] topo/analysis/vision.py:
	  change in parameters

2008-10-23  jbednar

	* [r9491] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Minor simplification

	  with startup

2008-10-22  jbednar

	* [r9489] topo/command/analysis.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Generalized FeatureCurveFunction to handle or_tuning as well, and
	  made measure_or_tuning into a ParameterizedFunction based on it.
	  Made measure_or_tuning support a list of units to measure, though
	  only in batch mode at present.

2008-10-22  ceball

	* [r9488] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Uncommented scheduled events.

2008-10-22  jbednar

	* [r9487] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Added hints for the analysis routines

	* [r9486] topo/command/analysis.py,

	  minor changes

2008-10-22  ceball

	* [r9484] contrib/lissom_oo_dr.ty:

	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_whisker_barrels.ty,
	  topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Cleaned up handling of duration and apply_output_fn, making the
	  defaults always be 1.0 and True, but overridable at the
	  PatternPresenter or MeasureResponseFunction levels (to allow easy
	  control in the GUI or from scripts). Made scripts that should
	  typically use 0.175 and False to set that up explicitly. Cleaned
	  up PatternPresenter's arguments, making them Parameters, except
	  pattern_generator, which is typically used as a positional
	  parameter.

	* [r9480] topo/command/analysis.py,
	  topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_t000100.00_Corner_OR_Preference.data:

	* [r9479] topo/command/analysis.py,
	  topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_t000100.00_Corner_OR_Preference.data:
	  Changed default duration and apply_output_fn for Corner
	  Orientation Preference, in preparation for next revision

2008-10-21  jbednar

	* [r9478] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Converted measure_cog to a ParameterizedFunction, and extended it
	  to have a reasonable default in nearly every feedforward network
	  (instead of only having a useful default for things with a
	  projection named Afferent)

	* [r9477] topo/command/basic.py:
	  Replaced run_batch with ParameterizedFunction version; should be
	  no change in behavior

2008-10-18  ceball

	* [r9476] topo/command/basic.py:

	  topo/pattern/random.py,
	  topo/pattern/rds.py:
	  Moved _check_params from Parameterized to ParamOverrides. Added
	  an option to ParamOverrides to allow extra (non-Parameter)
	  keywords to be handled without printing a warning.

2008-10-18  jbednar

	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Converted unit, projection, and RF plotting to use
	  ParameterizedFunctions.

	* [r9473] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Fixed RF measurement plot broken since r9414

	* [r9472] topo/command/analysis.py:
	  Reimplemented most map measurement commands as
	  ParameterizedFunctions so that their default values can be
	  controlled by users

2008-10-17  jbednar

	* [r9471] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Removed support for position parameter, probably temporarily.
	  Brought closer to using param override decorator syntax, but
	  still calling ParamOverrides explicitly

2008-10-17  antolikjan

	* [r9470] contrib/sparse_connectivity_model.ty:
	  further external parametrization added

2008-10-17  ceball

	* [r9469] topo/command/basic.py:
	  Made run_batch2's script_file be an argument rather than a
	  parameter.

	* [r9468] topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Added support for positional arguments to ParameterizedFunction.

2008-10-17  chrisjeffery

	  Minor cleanup; shouldn't be any significant change to behavior

	* [r9458] doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php:
	  Updated runtimes to match performance boost

	* [r9457] doc/News/index_text.php:
	  More news

2008-09-26  jbednar

	* [r9305] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Minor cleanup; should be no change to results

	* [r9304] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Changed to use schedule_event; should be no change in results

	* [r9303] topo/sheet/lissom.py:
	  Fixed longstanding tiny bug in parameter values -- the upper
	  threshold change at 500 iterations was being skipped for the
	  lissom_oo_or*.ty simulations, compared to the parameters in the
	  CMVC book. Changed it to match the book value, which does not
	  affect slow-tests (which only test to 250), but does affect the
	  final organized map slightly.

	* [r9302] examples/lissom_fsa.ty:
	  Simplified by using standard set of scheduled events, and
	  improved convergence, though it is still not as good as the
	  published version. The afferent learning rates and most of the
	  scheduled events are now different from the previous version, and
	  thus the results have changed significantly.

	* [r9301] topo/sheet/lissom.py:
	  Added control over afferent learning rate scaling

2008-09-25  jbednar

	  Removed obsolete code; see examples/cfsom_or.ty for current
	  approach

	* [r9296]
	  examples/sullivan_neurocomputing04.ty:
	  Changed to use current SOM implementation, to allow cfsom.py to
	  be deleted

	* [r9295]
	  examples/sullivan_neurocomputing04.ty:
	  Cleaned up formatting; should be no change in results

	* [r9294] Makefile,

	  Removed; not very useful

	* [r9291] examples/lissom_oo_or_dy.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or_dy_photo.ty:
	  Obsolete; DY simulation now in lissom.ty, though these files
	  produce somewhat different results and may still have some
	  information relevant to reproducing the Ramtohul (2006) thesis.
	  In particular, lissom_oo_or_dy_photo.ty shows how to use stereo
	  pair image inputs.

	* [r9290] examples/lissom_oo_od.ty:
	  Obsolete; OD simulation now in lissom.ty

	* [r9289] examples/lissom_or_sf.ty:
	  Obsolete; basic SF simulation now in lissom.ty, and Chris Palmer
	  has newer more complex SF sims

	* [r9288] examples/lissom_photo_or.ty:
	  Obsolete; photo simulation now in lissom.ty

	* [r9287] examples/lissom_oo_or_cr.ty:
	  Changed to use schedule_events; should be no change in results
	  (though not verified)

	* [r9286] examples/lissom_oo_or_cr.ty:
	  Cleaned up to match lissom.ty. May be deleted, as it can be
	  reproduced by lissom.ty, but kept as an example for now.

	* [r9285] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Minor simplification

	* [r9284] examples/lissom_oo_or_rg.ty:
	  Results can be reproduced using lissom.ty

	* [r9283] examples/lissom.ty,
	  topo/sheet/lissom.py:
	  Generalized schedule_events for use in lissom.ty; should have no
	  change in results for any simulation

	* [r9282] topo/sheet/lissom.py:
	  Fixed apparent bug in previous checkin

	* [r9281] examples/lissom.ty:

	  Moved scheduled events into a shared sheet.lissom.schedule_events
	  command

	  Added test for lissom.ty

	* [r9278] topo/tests/lissom.ty_DATA:
	  Current version, for reference

	* [r9277] examples/laminar_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or_noshrinking_latswitch.ty:
	  Minor cleanup, removing unused code. Should have no change in

	* [r9276] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Cleaned up formatting to match lissom_oo_or.ty; no change in

	  Trivial cleanup of formatting; no change in results

	* [r9274] examples/lissom_or.ty:

	  change in results.

	* [r9273]
	  examples/cc_lissom_oo_or_simple_rv.ty,
	  examples/lesi.ty:

	* [r9270] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed missed from r9269.

	* [r9269] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Simplified getting sheet coordinates from mouse events during
	  subsequent processing: store (x,y) of cell center in the event
	  (addresses ALERT: simplifies r9219 and r9265; should be no
	  visible change).

2008-09-22  jbednar

	* [r9268] doc/Downloads/index_text.php,
	  doc/FAQ/index_text.php:
	  Moved outdated warning into a FAQ

	* [r9267] topo/outputfn/basic.py:
	  Fixed formatting and docstring for recent changes. Simplified
	  first_call changes for HomeostaticMaxEnt

	* [r9266] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/learningfn/optimized.py,
	  topo/learningfn/projfn.py:
	  Moved CFPLF_PluginScaled out of base and into learningfn

	  property). Addresses SF.net #2118376.

	* [r9229] topo/param/parameterized.py,
	  topo/projection/basic.py:
	  Extracted get_all_slots() from Parameter so that it can also be
	  used in Parameterized objects that have slots. Added slot
	  handling to Parameterized instance pickling. Addresses part of
	  SF.net #2118376 (still need to add legacy support).

	  Extracted JointNormalizingCFSheet's compute_joint_norm_totals()
	  method into a function. JointNormalizingCFSheets now have a
	  joint_norm_fn parameter, allowing compute_joint_norm_totals_opt()
	  to be used independently of LISSOM_Opt (although the results
	  using compute_joint_norm_totals_opt() have not been verified
	  yet).

	* [r9180] etc/update_094_to_095:
	  Fixed bug in update script.

	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty,
	  topo/tests/reference/support_clissom/lissom5.gz:
	  Version of C++ lissom that outputs angle in radians rather than
	  degrees (removes added complexity of angle conversions). Also
	  added check of weights+activities just before first bounds
	  change, to aid detection of incorrect bounds changes. OO DR
	  simulation reverted to LISSOM (had been switched to LISSOM_Opt by
	  mistake).

	* [r9168]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_dr_reference.ty,

	* [r9159] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Added handling of del to weight_arrays and slice_arrays (missed
	  from previous commit).

	* [r9158] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/projection/basic.py:
	  Made _weight_arrays and _slice_arrays optimization more robust
	  (by making them properties, the lists of arrays can be created
	  when they are requested - which allows e.g. old snapshots to work
	  and means e.g. subclasses of CFProjection don't have to call code
	  to create the arrays). Haven't evaluated performance, but this
	  change should have little impact.

	  topo/sheet/generator.py,
	  topo/sheet/lissom.py:
	  Added basic.py and moved the basic Sheet classes into it, for
	  consistency with other library directories. Also made BoundingBox
	  available from topo.sheet, because it's required for using
	  Sheets.

	* [r9020] topo/tests/testcfsom.py:
	  Added missing import

	* [r9019] topo/misc/numbergenerator.py,
	  topo/numbergen,

	* [r9016]
	  examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr_dy_rg_cr.ty:
	  Right BoundingBox size: 0.27083 instead of 0.25; other trivial
	  changes.

	* [r9011] ChangeLog.txt,
	  Makefile:

	  in order to catch the tags marking releases

2008-08-26  ceball

	* [r9010] topo/command/basic.py:
	  Added missing close() for file (although I think it makes no
	  difference in this case because the file should have been closed
	  anyway when the function ended).

	* [r8929] topo/base/arrayutils.py,
	  topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Simplified script_repr() function. Should be no visible change to
	  output.

	* [r8928] topo/base/arrayutils.py:
	  Added support for script_repr() of ufuncs. SF #2051244.

	* [r8927] topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/param/parameterized.py:
	  Extracted basic functionality of Parameterized's script_repr()
	  method into a function that can be called on any object. Added
	  support to script_repr() for recursing into tuples as well as
	  lists. Added script_repr_dict, allowing custom functions to be
	  installed to handle specific types. script_repr() appears to work

2008-08-19  gerasymo

	* [r8926] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr_dy.ty:
	  BoundingBox size set correctly. Default max_disparity increased

	  New comment line.

2008-08-19  ceball

	* [r8923] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Downgraded priority of a task because it will probably have
	  little externally visible impact, and because I want to do it at
	  the same time as the other cf.py tasks.

	* [r8922] external,
	  external/numpy-1.0.2.tar.gz:

	  simulations cache_image set to false to avoid memory error.

	* [r8915]
	  examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr_dy_sf_rg_cr.ty:

	  Updated buildbot analysis after step was added to make
	  slow-tests.

	* [r8912] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:

	* [r8911] external/numpy.diff:
	  Updated patch for numpy 1.1.1.

	* [r8910] external/Makefile,
	  external/numpy-1.1.1.tar.gz:
	  Upgraded numpy to 1.1.1.

	* [r8909] Makefile:
	  Lowered precision required for matching slow-tests from 14 dp to

	* [r8904] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Cleaned up task list. Moved some tasks to sf.net trackers.

2008-08-15  gerasymo

	* [r8895]
	  topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_homeostatic.ty_DATA,
	  topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_homeostatic_tracked.ty_DATA:
	  Corrected svn:mime-type properties.

	* [r8894] examples/lissom_oo_or_dy_photo.ty:
	  Removed mistaken note.

	* [r8893] examples/lissom_oo_or_dy_photo.ty,
	  topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Made lissom_oo_or_dy_photo run without crashing.

	* [r8892]
	  topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_homeostatic.ty_DATA,
	  topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_homeostatic_tracked.ty_DATA:
	  Checked in data from r8891.

2008-08-13  ceball

	* [r8891] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Removed psyco option (users can still enable psyco in their
	  .topographicarc files).

	* [r8890] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Removed hacks from OutputFnWithRandomState classes; results of
	  simulations using these functions will now change because of
	  having different streams of random numbers.

	* [r8889] topo/outputfns/basic.py,
	  topo/tests/testoutputfnsbasic.py:
	  Created OutputFnWithRandomState, which allows output functions to
	  have a random number generator, and to save and restore its
	  state. Made PoissonSample and HomeostaticMaxEnt inherit from
	  OutputFnWithRandomState. For now, results of simulations using
	  these two output functions will not have changed (because of a
	  temporary hack; lissom_oo_or_homeostatic.ty checked).

2008-08-13  judelaw

	* [r8888]
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added call to update() (required for tkinter on os x when there's
	  no mainloop(); SF.net #2027001).

2008-08-13  ceball

	* [r8887] examples/lissom_oo_or_homeostatic.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or_homeostatic_tracked.ty,
	  topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Homeostatic output function no longer uses global numpy.random
	  RandomState - instead, it temporarily uses topo.patterns.random's
	  (so results of simulations depending on it have not changed).

	* [r8886] examples/lissom_oo_or_dy_photo.ty:
	  Added note that this example will be using different random
	  numbers.

	* [r8885] examples/lissom_or_sf.ty:
	  Made lissom_or_sf have same results after no longer using
	  numpy.random's global RandomState.

	  because image is with lower origin (flipped around), so arrows
	  must also be flipped around.

	* [r8853] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr_dy_rg.ty:
	  Display the simulation name according to dims added.

	* [r8852] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  For phase disparity, measurement made possible with other
	  dimensions (case when number of input sheets > 2). For ocularity
	  measurement, just trivial changes.

	* [r8851] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr_dy_rg.ty:
	  Default dimensions changed, RG excluded because computationally
	  intensive.

	  external/psyco-dist-svn42201.tar.gz,
	  external/psyco-dist-svn52800.tar.gz,
	  external/psyco-dist-svn56930.tar.gz:
	  Updated to psyco svn 56930.

2008-08-01  ceball

	* [r8849] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:
	  buildbot: added buildslave Heavy (msys on Windows); added OS X
	  aqua Tkinter patch. Changes have been live on buildbot for some
	  time.

	* [r8848] Makefile,
	  win_build_exe.py:
	  Added beginnings of automatic exe creation.

2008-08-01  gerasymo

	* [r8847] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  For the case that input sheets don't start with defining strings
	  (e.g. Left-, Right-, Red- or Green-), search for a substring will
	  be done in the name.

2008-08-01  antolikjan

	* [r8846] contrib/jacommands.py:
	  minor parameter changes in AddV2 and AddGC

	* [r8845]
	  examples/gc_lissom_oo_or_homeostatic_new.ty:
	  minor parameter changes

2008-08-01  gerasymo

	* [r8844] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr_dy_rg.ty:
	  File tested. With dataset Gaussians results are identical to
	  previous lissom_oo_or_od_dr_dy.ty in all dims combinations
	  (provided initial uniform distribution od weights), because input
	  for both (red and green) retinas are identical gaussians. With
	  dataset Nature in OR/RG mode results are identical to basic color
	  model of lissom_oo_or_rg.ty (again if initial weights set to
	  uniform).

2008-07-31  gerasymo

	* [r8843] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr_dy_rg.ty:
	  Red and green retinas added with necessary LGNs. Both retinas
	  receive identical input, so results of the file working with
	  gaussians and dims=['or'] and dims=['or', 'rg'] are both
	  identical to simple OR model (if initial weights are uniformly
	  distributed). Work in progress.

	* [r8842] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr_dy_rg.ty:
	  Loops for potential different cone types and different LGN
	  opponent types added. But their lists are still empty, that's why
	  results still identical to lisssom_oo_or_od_dr_dy.ty. Work in
	  progress.

	* [r8841] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr_dy_rg.ty:
	  Merging OR/OD/DR/DY with RG basic color model. Initially, file
	  copied from lissom_oo_or_od_dr_dy.ty and only LGN DoG were
	  separated. So, results still identical to the source file.

	* [r8840] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr_dy.ty:
	  Missing condition for learning rate definition added.

2008-07-30  antolikjan

	* [r8839]
	  examples/cc_lissom_oo_or_simple_rv.ty:
	  minor parameter changes

2008-07-30  gerasymo

	* [r8838] examples/lissom_oo_or_cr.ty:
	  Blue retina connected to LGNs, LGNs to V1, so all necessary
	  connections for a complete color model are there. Work in
	  progress.

	* [r8837] examples/lissom_oo_or_cr.ty:
	  Blue retina created, but not yet connected to any LGN, so resuts
	  still identical to lissom_oo_or_rg model.

	* [r8836] examples/lissom_oo_or_rg.ty:
	  This file contains a basic red-green model. The
	  lissom_oo_or_cr.ty will be extended beyond that to include also
	  bue color.

2008-07-29  antolikjan

	* [r8835] contrib/jacommands.py:
	  Modified the homeostatic_analysis_function() to count in the new

	* [r8831]
	  examples/cc_lissom_oo_or_simple_rv.ty:

	  some minor parameter changes

	* [r8830] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Deleted code related to now removed support for continuous
	  activity in ProjectionSheet

	* [r8829] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Deleted the code related to now removed support for continuos
	  activity in ProjectionSheet

	* [r8828] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Removed the part of code from ProjectionSheet that was allowing
	  to have continuouse activity in sheets - it has been now replaced
	  with a new output function ActivityHysteresis which is for now
	  only in contrib.jacommands

	* [r8827] contrib/jacommands.py:
	  Added ActivityHysteresis as a new output_fn and moved Translator
	  pattern generator to this file from topo

	  mistake).

	* [r8818] topo/plotting/bitmap.py:
	  Temporarily commented out title font code in bitmap (while
	  testing buildbot on Windows).

2008-07-22  ceball

	* [r8817] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:
	  Added pyc-clean to slow-tests. Reduced frequency of lodestar
	  tests (although going to move to another machine eventually).
	  These changes have been in effect on buildbot for a while
	  already.

	* [r8816] Makefile:
	  Don't use 'time' on msys, but restore for other platforms.

	* [r8815] Makefile:
	  Msys: updated patch (work in progress).

	* [r8814] external/win32_static.tar.gz:

	  Moved TAE measurement into a function. Added DAE measurement
	  (total hack, unlikely to be correct).

	* [r8809] contrib/ae.py:
	  Initial version. Original script by rczhao, cleanup by JAB
	  (emailed 2007-11-15), minor updates by CB. (Intention is to
	  generalize this code and put it in topo.)

	* [r8808] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Minor simplification.

	* [r8807] topo/misc/legacy.py:
	  Restored handling of DynamicNumber in old snapshots (had been
	  temporarily commented out while parameterclasses was removed).

	* [r8806] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Restored topo.base.parameterclasses while contrib/ and possibly
	  other user code depends on it. (The legacy support installed to
	  replace it is only applied for snapshots by default.)

	* [r8805] examples/saccade_demo.ty:
	  Updated import statement.

	* [r8668] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr_photo.ty:
	  Copied from lissom_oo_or_od_dr.ty -r 8656 and adjusted to receive
	  images as input. Doesn't have image specific parameters yet.
	  Produces OR and DR maps, but no OD, since scale for both eyes is

	* [r8663] contrib/jsldefs.py:
	  added state_push and state_pop to JointScaling_lronly and
	  JointScaling_affonly. Added temporary changing of homeostatic
	  parameters during orientation preference map measurement in
	  homeostatic_analysis_function. This is to allow comparison of map
	  selectivity for different simulations and at different timepoints
	  during development

	* [r8662] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  added state_push and state_pop in JointScaling so that state can
	  be saved to the __curent_state_stack and restored at a later time
	  (for example when measuring orientation selectivity maps)

	* [r8661] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  added state_push and state_pop in HomeostaticMaxEnt so that state
	  can be saved to the __curent_state_stack and restored at a later
	  time (for example when measuring orientation selectivity maps)

	* [r8660] topo/base/functionfamilies.py:
	  added state_push and state_pop to PipelineOF so that Output
	  functions in a pipeline can save and restore their state if they
	  have a state_push and state_pop function

	  examples/lissom_oo_or_homeostatic_tracked.ty:
	  Version of lissom_oo_or_homeostatic.ty with all necessary

	  counter examples where simulation doesn't work. Also includes all
	  tracking and analysis functions. Not yet fully tested.

	* [r8647] examples/lissom_oo_or_homeostatic.ty:
	  Brought up to date with version to be published. Removed all
	  debugging and tracking code and replaced with separate file
	  (lissom_oo_or_homeostatic_tracked.ty). Renamed sparsity as
	  frequency and type_input as dataset

	* [r8646] topo/outputfns/basic.py:

2008-06-15  gerasymo

	* [r8642] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr.ty:
	  Array dims added, with the help of which it is possible to create
	  different combinations of maps running one file
	  (lissom_oo_or_od_dr.ty)with appropriate dims values. E.g.
	  dims=['or'] will give OR map identical to that created with
	  lissom_oo_or.ty(if in the latter scale is chosen from [0,2]);
	  dims=['or','od'] gives OR and OD maps identical to those from
	  lissom_oo_or_od.ty(if in the latter only one gaussian is
	  inputed); etc.

2008-06-06  jbednar

	* [r8613] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr.ty:
	  Minor reformatting

2008-06-06  ceball

	* [r8612] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:
	  Updated creation of shell commands to work with new buildbot
	  version 0.7.7 (fixes SF #1981218).

	* [r8611] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:
	  Added cleaning of pyc files and renamed c++ reference builder.
	  (These changes have been in effect on the buildbot itself for at
	  least a month.)

2008-06-05  gerasymo

	* [r8610] examples/lissom_oo_or_cr.ty:
	  No changes in respect of content, just how it looks like.

	* [r8609] examples/lissom_oo_or_cr.ty:
	  Third LGN layer added, so now there are all needed layers for
	  basic color model (Red/Green, Green/Red, Luminosity).Because of
	  the identical input pattern for both red and green retinas,
	  resulted activities and OR preference map is identical to
	  lissom_oo_or.ty.

2008-06-04  gerasymo

	* [r8608] examples/lissom_oo_or_cr.ty:
	  Two layers of LGN (Red/Green and Green/Red) added. For Red/Green,
	  the center input comes from red retina, the surrounding from the
	  green retina, respectively for Green/Red. Learning rates
	  adjusted, so maps identical to lissom_oo_or.ty are built, because
	  of the identical input patterns on both red and green retinas.

	* [r8607] examples/lissom_oo_or_cr.ty:
	  Mistake in the connections corrected.

	* [r8606] examples/lissom_oo_or_cr.ty:
	  Instead of one, there are now two identical retinas, so one LGN
	  receives input from two retinas: central part from one and
	  surrounding part from the second retina. Because of the identical
	  input patterns on both retinas, no effect on the map - the same
	  map as lissom_oo_or.ty

	* [r8605] examples/lissom_oo_or_cr.ty:
	  Inputs for central and surround gaussians of LGN separated, but
	  because of only one retina it still doesnt't have any effect. So
	  maps identical to lissom_oo_or.ty can be built. Model editor
	  temporarily commented.

2008-06-04  antolikjan

	* [r8604] examples/cc_lissom_oo_or_pokus.ty:
	  Changed some parameters to be configurable through -c option

2008-06-03  gerasymo

	* [r8603] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  New plotgroup created for building OR map overlaid with both OD
	  contours and DR arrows. It can be temporarily accessed in the
	  Combined Preference Maps category.

	* [r8602] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr.ty:
	  Two eyes added with inputs scaled differently as required for OD.
	  Also model editor extended to suit the model. OR/OD/DR maps can
	  be build.

	* [r8601] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Changes in patterns presented for ocular preference map
	  measurement. Difference in scale for inputs to the left and right
	  retinas made independent of the number of input sheets; scale
	  depends only on whether the input goes to the left or right.

	* [r8600] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Changes in presented input for direction map measurement. Lag
	  numbers are made to correspond to the Sweeper step, so e.g. by
	  two eyes, inputs to different eyes with the same lag number get
	  the same translation.

	  Added images for color model.

2008-05-28  gerasymo

	* [r8568] examples/lissom_oo_or_cr.ty:
	  Created file for basic color model. Copied from
	  lissom_oo_or_dr.ty -r 8562, but without translation and with one
	  LGN layer. So at this stage maps identical to lissom_oo_or.ty can
	  be buit.

	* [r8567] topo/commands/pylabplots.py:
	  Small cosmetic changes made to overlaid_plots.

2008-05-27  gerasymo

	* [r8566] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Combined Preference Maps category in the Plots menu is added. It
	  has an option of plotting the Orientation and Ocular Preference
	  map, that is OR map overlaid with OD boundaries with the help of
	  overlaid_plots function.

	* [r8565] topo/commands/pylabplots.py:
	  Function overlaid_plots added for creating combined plots.
	  Combined plot is build from a template plot overlaid with
	  contours of another map, both specified in parameters.

2008-05-26  gerasymo

	* [r8564] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Scale of the presented input patterns for direction map
	  measurement increased to 0.6.

2008-05-23  jbednar

	* [r8563] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr.ty:
	  Added warnings

2008-05-23  gerasymo

	* [r8562] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty,
	  topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Added a variable item_scale, which determines the size of items
	  in diagram, to the Simulation class. It is used in editorwindow
	  for scaling determination. In lissom_oo_or_dr.ty, it can be
	  overwritten by the grid_layout as its parameter.

	* [r8561] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty:
	  Set speed to be independent of retinal units.

	* [r8560]
	  doc/Developer_Manual/revisioncontrol_text.php:
	  Added note about enabling auto-props

	* [r8559] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Scale of presented input patterns for direction preference map
	  increased to 0.5; number of tested direction set to 6; max_speed
	  set to ensure equal distance moved with respect to sheet
	  coordinates.

2008-05-22  jbednar

	* [r8558] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr.ty:
	  Fixed keywords

	* [r8557] topo/params/__init__.py:
	  Minor clarification

2008-05-22  gerasymo

	* [r8556] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty:
	  Build default locations for Model editor.

	* [r8555] examples/lissom_oo_or_od_dr.ty:
	  Copied from lissom_oo_or_dr.ty -r 8527

	* [r8554] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Change for the direction map measurement: scale increased to 0.4,
	  because the previous of 0.2 was to low to be detected; max_speed
	  set according to the density of retina.

2008-05-21  gerasymo

	* [r8553] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty:
	  Variable speed added for variation of translation speed of an
	  input pattern on the different retinas. Array strength added,
	  which is indexed by the variable speed and stores the LGN
	  afferent scale for different speeds to make the response stronger
	  (as in CMVC).

2008-05-20  jbednar

	* [r8552] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Temporarily (?) enabled docking to allow people to check it out

2008-05-20  gerasymo

	* [r8551] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty:
	  Speed increased.

2008-05-19  jbednar

	* [r8550] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty:
	  Minor fix to doc

2008-05-19  gerasymo

	* [r8549] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty:
	  Simulation number corrected.

2008-05-19  jbednar

	* [r8548] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Improved run_batch handling of filenames for command-line
	  parameters that are lists, so that dimensions=['OR','OD','DR']
	  gives dimensions=OR_OD_DR instead of something with brackets and
	  quotations

2008-05-19  gerasymo

	* [r8547] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty:
	  Orientation of an input pattern set to zero at first; it is
	  defined later in Sweeper.

2008-05-19  jbednar

	* [r8546] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Minor fix

	* [r8545] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added note

	* [r8544] topo/misc/numbergenerators.py:
	  Changed to use new organization of params/ as an example

	* [r8543] topo/params/__init__.py:
	  Temporarily (?) added Parameterized to simplify imports

2008-05-18  gerasymo

	* [r8542] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty:
	  Added Sweeper for translation of input on retinas.

2008-05-18  ceball

	* [r8541] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/base/projection.py:
	  Moved get_projection_view() up to Projection, since it appears to
	  be valid for all Projections.

	* [r8540] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Improvement to docking (when windows start undocked, the dock
	  manager no longer appears then disappears).

	* [r8539] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Minor fixes for docking.

	* [r8538] topo/params/tk.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Renamed FrameManager to DockManager and made it work with
	  Toplevels that are turned into Frames (rather than Frames that
	  are turned into Toplevels). Made various related changes,
	  including fixes for SF #1963861 ('Problem opening and closing
	  Activity windows') and #1951348 ('Windows resize when Go is
	  clicked'). Code still requires cleanup in several places.

2008-05-17  gerasymo

	* [r8537] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty:
	  Added Sweeper for translation of input patterns for different
	  retinas, but still with speed=0; so builds the same map as
	  lissom_oo_or.ty

	* [r8536] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty:
	  Substituted class Opposite through arithmetic expression doing
	  the same.

	* [r8535] examples/lissom_oo_or_od.ty:
	  Deleted import copy; no need for this now since class Opposite,
	  which was using it, is no longer there.

2008-05-16  jbednar

	* [r8534] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Cleaned up docstrings

	* [r8533] doc/News/index_text.php:
	  Added recent news

	* [r8532] examples/lissom_oo_or_od.ty:
	  Removed Opposite class now that NumberGenerators support
	  arithmetic.

	* [r8531] topo/misc/numbergenerators.py:
	  Added explicit NumberGenerator base class to provide support for
	  using NumberGenerators in arithmetic expressions (yielding other
	  NumberGenerators)

	* [r8530] examples/lissom_oo_or_od.ty:
	  Restored brightness differences between the two eyes, probably
	  omitted by mistake in previous checkin.

	* [r8529] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Added hack to make behavior in Emacs shell mode less confusing

	* [r8528] topo/base/arrayutils.py,
	  topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/base/sheetcoords.py,
	  topo/misc/distribution.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py,
	  topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Removed obsolete references to Numeric in docstrings and comments

2008-05-15  gerasymo

	* [r8527] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty:
	  Added 4 retinas and LGN lags; still identical input patterns for
	  all retinas (without translation), so produces the same map as
	  lissom_oo_or.ty

	* [r8526] examples/lissom_oo_or_dr.ty:
	  Copied from lissom_oo_or.ty -r 8223; then identical code for
	  different eyes and response types substituted with loops;
	  produces the same map as lissom_oo_or.ty

2008-05-14  jbednar

	* [r8525] doc/Reference_Manual/index_text.php:
	  Minor update

2008-05-14  ceball

	* [r8524] topo/__init__.py,

	  support to topo.__init__).

	* [r8523] topo/base/__init__.py,
	  topo/base/arrayutils.py:
	  Moved numpy ufunc pickle support from topo.base.arrayutils to
	  topo.__init__ so that it is always executed by Topographica.
	  Fixes unreported bug where a snapshot could not be saved if an
	  instance used a ufunc somewhere, but no function from
	  topo.base.arrayutils was imported.

	* [r8522] topo/misc/legacy.py:
	  Updated Simulation time_type legacy code. Fixes SF #1962509.

	* [r8521] examples/lissom_oo_or_od.ty:
	  Added Opposite class and other infrastructure for running OD
	  sims, but still with identical patterns in the two eyes, and thus
	  still should match lissom_oo_or.ty. Also fixed to allow a single
	  eye again, with eyes=[''].

	  bars should now always be visible - sf.net #1884341). Model
	  editor's parametersframe is now a themed window (i.e. has icon,
	  etc). These changes are mixed in with several other experimental
	  alterations to docking (should have no visible effect right now).

	  gmpy itself).

	* [r8378] topo/__init__.py:
	  Switched from mxnumber to gmpy.

	* [r8377] external/Makefile:

2008-04-20  ceball

	* [r8373] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  No visible change - removed unnecessary variable.

	* [r8372] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Simplified and corrected Translator (or, misunderstood its

	* [r8371] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Added ALERT.

	* [r8370] examples/lissom_oo_dr.ty:

	  width...).

	* [r8369]
	  topo/tests/reference/common_control.py,

	  Simplifications to checking: always checks both weights and
	  activities (at the expense of using more disk space and taking

2008-04-19  jbednar

	  Fixed minor mistake where activities were checked before weights.

	* [r8362]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_dr_reference.ty:
	  Continued setting up to try to match c++ simulation (now the
	  topographica and c++ lissom simulations look similar, but the
	  initial pattern on the retina is very slightly different).

	* [r8361]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_log_parser.py:
	  Fixed problem where minus signs were not detected in lissom's log
	  file (and also changed method for retrieving sign from lissom's
	  log file - which I did because I thought the original method was
	  broken, until I found the minus sign problem; the newer method is
	  clearer anyway).

	  Include exc_rad in params passed to lissom.

	* [r8351]
	  topo/tests/reference/common_control.py,

	  Set exc_rad in param file. Added function to check only array
	  sizes (the comparisons functions already check sizes, but this
	  function is to check only the sizes).

	  test.

	  Fixed Simulation's handling of register, so that a Simulation is
	  correctly a singleton or not. Moved most of the
	  singleton-specific code into a separate class. Although the
	  'register' behavior is now correct and passes the unit tests, the
	  implementation might change.

	* [r8223] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Removed explicit request for FixedPoint from some examples.

	  remain using FixedPoint.

	* [r8216] topo/__init__.py:
	  Set Simulation's default time_type to mx.Number.Float (if
	  available - otherwise, uses fixedpoint.FixedPoint).

	* [r8215] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Added time_type and time_type_args parameters to Simulation.

	* [r8214] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Made as_uninitialized be a function. Should be no visible change.

	* [r8213] topo/tests/testsimulation.py:
	  Added test to show that when unpickling a Simulation, the class's
	  register value is used (rather than that from the instance being
	  unpickled).

	* [r8212] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Fixed copying of register=False simulations.

	* [r8211] topo/tests/testsimulation.py:
	  More corrections to register=False test (still fails, which is
	  correct).

	* [r8210] topo/tests/testsimulation.py:
	  Testing Simulation's register parameter: Made pickle use protocol
	  2 (the same as we use in save_snapshot), and corrected
	  register_is_false test to show that copy & deepcopy of a
	  Simulation(register=False) instance are currently broken.

	* [r8209] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Clarified comments about Simulation.

	* [r8203] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Updates to comments about copying Simulation.

	* [r8202] topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/tests/testsimulation.py:
	  Made simulation(register=False) not be a singleton (i.e. only one
	  instance of Simulation(register=True) can exist, but
	  Simulation(register=False) instances exist as normal objects).

2008-03-15  ceball

	* [r8201] topo/__init__.py:
	  Added svn version to 'about' text.

	* [r8200] topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/tests/testsimulation.py:
	  Made Simulation be a singleton (unimportant change from it being
	  a 'monostate' class). Added methods to control copying and
	  pickling. Simulation's 'register' parameter no longer affects the
	  Simulation's status as a singleton.

	* [r8199] topo/tests/test_pattern_present.txt,

	  topo/base/sheetcoords.py,
	  topo/misc/legacy.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Intermediate checkin - cleaning up Slice and ConnectionField.
	  Moved Slice from topo.base.sheet to topo.base.sheetcoords.
	  Implemented __copy__ for Slice and altered code in
	  ConnectionField to copy() slices rather than deepcopy() them.
	  (Startup time improvement.) Avoid unnecessary creation of
	  BoundingBox objects (alter exising ones): BoundingRegion has
	  set() method. (Startup time improvement). Moved bounds2slice()
	  and slice2bounds from SheetCoordinateSystem to Slice and avoided
	  unnecessary creation of BoundingBox objects; still needs work.
	  (Startup time improvement.) Moved ConnectionField's
	  slice-construction methods into Slice (needs cleanup).
	  ConnectionField takes one 'template' argument rather than a
	  required BoundingRegion and an optional Slice; the template could
	  be a BoundingRegion or a Slice. (Passing a Slice instead of a
	  BoundingRegion is more complex, but avoids duplication of
	  calculations for every CF.) Moved mask-creation code from
	  CFProjection to ConnectionField (not yet sure this change will
	  stay). Updated topo.misc.legacy.

	  topo/base/functionfamilies.py,
	  topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/misc/utils.py:

	* [r8000] topo/base/functionfamilies.py,
	  topo/base/projection.py:
	  Removed override_plasticity_state() and
	  restore_plasticity_state() from OutputFn, reverting OutputFn to a
	  more general class; users of OutputFns must test for presence of
	  the methods (rather than assuming they exist). Added mechanism to

	* [r7982] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:

	  startup time 4-5% faster.)

	* [r7981] topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  Reverted Event to object (rather than ParameterizedObject -

	* [r7980] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:

	* [r7975] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/tests/testparameterizedobject.py:
	  Addressed SF.net request #1829846: added 'readonly' to Parameter,
	  allowing Parameters that can only be set when they are declared.
	  (Also added unit test, and unit test for constant Parameters.)

	* [r7974] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  File missed from commit 7973 (name Parameter is constant).

	* [r7973] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  ParameterizedObject: made name a constant Parameter; provided
	  _set_name() for when the name really does need to change; tried
	  to simplify controlling the 'initialized' flag by providing a
	  decorator function to manage it.

	* [r7972] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Made Simulation's name not be constant.

	* [r7971] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Made EditorObject and ModelEditor inherit from object rather than
	  ParameterizedObject (they should both have ParameterizedObject as
	  a parent, but that requires more than just changing the parent
	  class to ParameterizedObject - e.g. initializing the parent
	  class).

	  Minor changes to documentation.

	* [r7636] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Added some comments.

	* [r7635] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Fix failing test: save_input_generators() does topo.sim.run(0) to
	  start generator sheets.

	* [r7634] topo/tests/test_pattern_present.txt:
	  Added test to show that save_input_generators() causes a problem
	  with the event queue.

	* [r7633] topo/tests/testpatternpresent.py:
	  Removed redundant test.

	* [r7632] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Fixed oversight in previous checkin.

	* [r7631] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Improvement on r7630: better workaround for SF.net bug 1860837
	  (plot creation no longer happens, rather than happening but not
	  being displayed).

2008-01-16  ceball

	* [r7630] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added temporary workaround for SF.net bug 1860837 (i.e. avoid
	  plotting weights when only the hue+confidence are present).

2008-01-16  jbednar

	* [r7629] topo/misc/keyedlist.py:
	  Removed warning

2008-01-16  ceball

	  Minor updates to lissom_oo_or tutorial.

	* [r7626] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Fixed bug where Default was not properly being restored
	  (Eval_ReprTranslator now caches last object and its string
	  representation when object2string is called).

	* [r7625] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  On opening a ParametersFrame, set the initial state of the Apply
	  button.

	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,

	  Apply button is disabled if there are no changes. Fixed bug where
	  looking up default value for a ClassSelectorParameter overwrote
	  the current value.

	  removed.)

	* [r7621] external,
	  external/Python-2.4.4.tgz,
	  external/pylint-0.7.0.tar.gz:
	  Cleaned up external/ directory.

	  Minor simplifications to startup process.

	* [r7616] external/Makefile,
	  topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Changed to use IPython by default. (Make Ipython by default;
	  CommandPrompt classes now relate to IPython.)

	* [r7615] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Changed default prompt to 'topo_tn>>>' where n is
	  topo.sim.time().

2008-01-15  jbednar

	* [r7614] Makefile:
	  Removed outdated alert

2008-01-15  ceball

	* [r7613] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Fixed bug where a sub-ParametersFrame could not be displayed for
	  a Parameter of a class (class objects have name=None).

	* [r7612] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  When representing a ClassSelectorParameter, the choices (classes)
	  are not instantiated until an object is actually required.

	* [r7611] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Added mechanism to allow prompt control for IPython.

	* [r7610] external/Makefile,
	  external/ipython-0.8.2.tar.gz:
	  Upgraded IPython to 0.8.2.

	* [r7609] Makefile,
	  topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Experiment: made IPython only start if -i (or -g) is given.
	  (Change only affects those who have IPython built.)

	* [r7608] external/Makefile,
	  external/progressbar-2.2.tar.gz:
	  Added progressbar from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar/.

2008-01-14  jprovost

	* [r7607] Makefile:
	  Fixed version check so it works from outside TOPOROOT. Also added
	  pissy comment about same.

2008-01-14  ceball

	* [r7606] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Undid part of previous commit: accidentally committed code to
	  change the apply button color.

	* [r7605] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Default value for a parameter is shown in pop-up help. Changed
	  status indications: red widget text for an error, and blue widget
	  text for an unapplied change.

	  topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/base/parameterclasses.py,

	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Minor alert

2008-01-14  ceball

	* [r7603] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  PlotGroupPanel's auto_refresh was moved to plotgroup so there
	  should no longer be a Parameter declaration in any subclasses.

	  /branches/topographica-tkgui_with_tile/external/snit1.0.tar.gz:
	  Added snit (snit is from http://www.wjduquette.com/snit). Build
	  tile by default.

	* [r7589] /branches/topographica-tkgui_with_tile/external/Makefile:
	  Added scrodget. Commented out Tilewrapper (which we don't use).

	* [r7588]
	  /branches/topographica-tkgui_with_tile/external/pyscrodget-0.0.1_2.1.tar.gz:
	  Scrodget wrapped for Tkinter. (Package does not exist elsewhere.)

	* [r7587]

	  /branches/topographica-tkgui_with_tile/topo/tkgui/topowidgets.py,
	  /branches/topographica-tkgui_with_tile/topo/tkgui/widgets.py:

	  Made lissom_oo_or.ty use floating-point time.

	* [r7583] /branches/topographica-float-sim-time:
	  Delete topographica-float-sim-time branch: finished making
	  changes to Simulation time.

	* [r7582] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Fix to previous commit: support previously saved snapshots.

	* [r7581] examples/*.ty,
	  topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/tests/test_pattern_present.txt:
	  Merged branches/topographica-float-sim-time changes r7566:7580
	  into the trunk (i.e. make Simulation time be float rather than
	  FixedPoint by default, but keep all existing example scripts
	  using FixedPoint). Should be no visible change to existing
	  example scripts.

	* [r7580]
	  /branches/topographica-float-sim-time/:
	  Made use of FixedPoint simulation time explicit (simulations
	  should all be identical to when Simualtion's time was FixedPoint
	  by default.

	* [r7579] doc/Downloads/index_text.php:
	  Added direct link to SF.net Windows download page.

	* [r7578] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:

	* [r7570]
	  /branches/topographica-float-sim-time/examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  After switching Simulation's default time type to be float,
	  revert lissom_oo_or's time type to be FixedPoint.

	* [r7569]
	  /branches/topographica-float-sim-time/topo/tests/test_pattern_present.txt:
	  Changed test to work whatever the time type.

	* [r7568]
	  /branches/topographica-float-sim-time/topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Added set_time() method to allow Simulation time's type to be

	  Creating branch for modifying tkgui to work with Tile.

	* [r7566] /branches/topographica-float-sim-time:

2008-01-10  ceball

	* [r7565] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/tests/testNumberParameter.txt:
	  Clarified current limitation of Number/FixedPoint combination.

	* [r7564] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Provide backwards compatibility for snapshots created before
	  ConnectionField's slice_array was renamed to input_sheet_slice.
	  (Fixes failing snapshot-compatibility-tests.)

	* [r7563] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Fixed bug in Singleton: previously, there could be more than one
	  instance of Singleton after copying or pickling - now there can
	  only ever be one. This fixes a bug in snapshot loading: after
	  more than one save-load sequence, topo.sim was no longer being
	  set to the Simulation being unpickled.

	* [r7562] doc/Downloads/win32notes_text.php:
	  Clarifications to Windows-specific notes.

	* [r7561]
	  /trunk/topographica-win/create_installer/topographica.iss:
	  Added missing 'WorkingDir' specification to desktop icon.

2008-01-09  ceball

	* [r7560] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:
	  buildbot's slow-tests separates performance tests from
	  snapshot-tests.

	* [r7559] Makefile:
	  Removed snapshot-tests from slow-tests in Makefile (temporary -
	  for buildbot).

	* [r7558] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Removed experimental optimization of PatternGenerator (i.e. undo
	  changes 7524 and 7525). (The change made very little performance
	  improvement, and appears to cause a problem with Image.)

2008-01-09  rczhao

	* [r7557] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Bugs fixed - changed all orientation=['orientation'] to
	  orientation=params['orientation']

2008-01-09  ceball

	* [r7556] topo/base/cf.py,

2008-01-08  ceball

	* [r7550] Makefile:
	  Switch order of slow-tests so that pickle failures don't stop
	  performance data from being collected.

	* [r7549] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Added comments and questions related to ConnectionFields.

2008-01-07  ceball

	* [r7542] topo/tests/test_script.py:
	  Minor adjustment to startup-speed-tests so output can be
	  distinguished from speed-tests output.

	* [r7541] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Made Slice be consistent about representing __slice (was
	  sometimes an array, sometimes a tuple; now it's always a tuple,
	  but it should be changed to be an array). Should be no visible
	  change.

	* [r7540] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Minor optimization (should be no visible change): _check_params()
	  is called many times, so it is worthwhile to reduce the number of
	  attribute lookups it performs. (Also corrected warning message.)

	* [r7539] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Replaced our classlist function with one from the standard
	  library. (Should improve startup speed slightly.)

	* [r7538] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/misc/utils.py:
	  Removed apparently unnecessary copying of bounds_template and
	  slice_template.

	* [r7537] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Moved copying of mask_template inside ConnectionField. Should be
	  no visible change.

	* [r7536] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Moved copying of bounds_template inside ConnectionField. Should
	  be no visible change.

	* [r7535] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Added some default values to ConnectionField. (No visible change,
	  but arguments have been swapped around; not yet finished.)

	* [r7534] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Fixed mistakes in previous checkin: restored an accidentally
	  removed call to gui(); if -g is passed, don't need to call
	  interactive() again.

	* [r7533] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Restored printing of BANNER if topographica is invoked with no
	  options or the -g option. Tried to simplify handling of
	  'interactive' use.

	* [r7532] Makefile,
	  topo/tests/test_script.py:
	  Added startup-speed-tests.

	* [r7525] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  PatternGenerator: (add hack to) allow earlier snapshot to load.

	* [r7524] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  PatternGenerator: try caching some stages of generating patterns
	  (experiment to try on buildbot; might revert).

	* [r7523] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Minor optimization of Parameter.__get__: avoid a method call if
	  possible.

	* [r7522] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py:
	  Removed unused import.

	* [r7521] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  ListParameter: removed check for being set to Dynamic value
	  generator before calling check_value(). Presumably the test was
	  always useless?

	* [r7520] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/tests/testNumberParameter.txt:
	  Added commented-out test to show that Number does not work with
	  FixedPoint.

	* [r7519] topo/responsefns/projfns.py:
	  Removed unused import.

	* [r7518] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Cleaned up Number parameter: no visible change.

	* [r7517] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Minor internal cleanup of Dynamic: no visible change.

	* [r7516] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Cleaned up which Dynamic method to check for when performing
	  different operations.

	* [r7515] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/tests/testCompositeParameter.txt,
	  topo/tests/testDynamicParameter.txt,
	  topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Clean up of Dynamic parameter (documentation, method names).
	  Visible change: only callables are suitable for producing dynamic
	  values. (Previously, anything with a next() method could also be
	  used, but since we can't use iterators anyway, that was
	  misleading [SF.net 1864370].)

	* [r7514] Makefile:
	  Reorganized snapshot-tests (to consist of
	  snapshot-compatibility-tests and simulation-snapshot-tests).
	  Fixed simulation-snapshot-tests's rm command (removed erroneous
	  quotation marks).

	* [r7513] Makefile,
	  topo/tests/test_script.py:
	  Altered slow snapshot tests so that they check real simulations
	  run the same after loading as they would have done if no snapshot
	  had been involved (rather than simply that snapshots save and
	  load; would have caught recent snapshot-with-Dynamic parameters
	  bug that our unit test of snapshots could not catch).

	* [r7512] Makefile:
	  Modified topographica's version-setting command so that we get
	  something closer to the code's actual version number.

	* [r7511] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Added ALERT.

	* [r7510] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Fixed mistake in earlier checkin: './topographica' is the same as
	  './topographica -i'.

	* [r7509] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Fixed bug where Dynamic parameters did not work after loading a
	  snapshot (Dynamic.time_fn did not point to the unpickled
	  simulation).

	* [r7508] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Added support for loading snapshots when parameter names have
	  been changed. Added unrelated ALERT about repr of
	  ParameterizedObjects with Dynamic parameters.

	* [r7507] Makefile:
	  Added comment to topographica script.

	* [r7506] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Corrected error message: when loading a snapshot, if a parameter
	  from the snapshot cannot be set on the current class, it is not
	  because the parameter's name has changed (most likely it is
	  because the Parameter object has changed).

	* [r7505] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  When restoring a snapshot, set parameter values directly on the
	  class rather than first temporarily storing the values in
	  __main__.__dict__.

	* [r7504] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Fixed bug where 'topographica -i' and 'topographica -g' did not
	  stay open if there was an error in a '-c' command.

	* [r7503] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added commented-out logging code for tkgui.

2008-01-04  ceball

	* [r7502] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Simplified some code that sets a class attribute (now we can set
	  underscore attributes on ParameterizedObjectMetaclasses without
	  getting a warning).

	* [r7501] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Corrected warning message.

	* [r7500] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Cleaned up mess surrounding ParameterizedObject's __getstate__
	  method (i.e. now it can be removed without getting myseterious
	  warnings; the myseterious warnings are from
	  ParameterizedObjectMetaclass complaining about __slotnames__
	  being cached on the class by python itself).
	  ParameterizedObjectMetaclass now does not warn about a
	  non-Parameter class attribute being set if the attribute name
	  starts with an underscore (_).

	* [r7499] topo/base/arrayutils.py:
	  Replaced an ALERT with a note.

	* [r7498] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py,
	  topo/outputfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/outputfns/projfns.py:
	  Finished implementing the 'promoting basic.py' plan for outputfns
	  (i.e. added __all__ to the outputfns modules that were missing
	  it).

	* [r7497] topo/tkgui/editortools.py:
	  Model Editor no longer displays a popup to ask for a new Sheet's
	  name (i.e. revert to code from r7481; the EP-name bug has been
	  fixed elsewhere, so you can now add sheets before setting 'name'
	  without an error).

	* [r7496] Makefile:
	  Fixed quotation mark error in previous checkin.

	* [r7495] topo/__init__.py:
	  The topographica script tries to store the Subversion version
	  number in topo.version. (File missed from previous checkin.)

	* [r7494] Makefile,
	  topo/commands/basic.py:
	  The topographica script tries to store the Subversion version
	  number in topo.version.

	* [r7493] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Fixed bug where EPs could be created with name=None.

	* [r7492] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Removed cvs2svn task from future work.

2008-01-03  ceball

	* [r7491] doc/Downloads/cvs_text.php:
	  Changed references to 'topographica.svn.sf.net' to
	  'topographica.svn.sourceforge.net' because SF's https certificate
	  is only valid for sourceforge.net (i.e. avoid people seeing
	  'certificate validation' warnings).

	* [r7490] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:
	  Switched buildbot to use SVNPoller instead of email changesource.

	* [r7489] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:
	  Updated buildbot configuration to work with SVN rather than CVS.

	* [r7488]
	  doc/Developer_Manual/revisioncontrol_text.php:
	  First pass at updating developmer manual revision control from
	  CVS to SVN.

	* [r7487] doc/Developer_Manual/index_text.php,
	  doc/Downloads/cvs_text.php:
	  Moved 'joining as a developer' from downloads page to developer
	  manual front page.

	* [r7486] doc/Downloads/cvs_text.php,
	  doc/Downloads/index_text.php:
	  First pass at converting download instructions from CVS to SVN.
	  Windows instructions not yet changed at all.

	* [r7485] /trunk/facespace/aam_fit_data.h5:
	  Changed properties: the file is binary.

	* [r7484] /tags/*/*/*/.cvsignore:
	  Information in .cvsignore already exists (in svn:ignore).

	* [r7483] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Added some notes.

	* [r7482] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Added some ALERTs.

	* [r7481] topo/tkgui/editortools.py:
	  Ask for sheet name when creating a sheet.

2008-01-02  ceball

	* [r7480] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Adjustment to cvs2svn procedure: taking LATEST_STABLE with us.
	  (Also, added some code that has no home in a note at the end of
	  the file.)

	* [r7479] external/Makefile:
	  Previous checkin was an accident - revert to version 1.98

	* [r7478] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php,
	  external/Makefile:
	  Added extra notes for cvs2svn conversion.

2008-01-01  rczhao

	* [r7477] /trunk/facespace/perception.ty:
	  Totally new version; now able to demonstrate face adaptation
	  aftereffects in one-dimensional face space

	* [r7476] /trunk/facespace/face_space.ty:
	  Set presented face interval 0.01.

2007-12-30  ceball

	* [r7475] examples/run.py:
	  Fixed 'default_density' position bug. Fortunately it wasn't
	  affecting the tutorial (only use of this script so far).

	* [r7474] topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  Temporarily use Constant() as input generator when
	  push_generator() is called.

	* [r7473] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Added comment.

2007-12-30  ceball_cvs2svn

	* [r7472] /tags/release_0_9_4, /tags/release_0_9_4/facespace:
	  This commit was manufactured by cvs2svn to create tag
	  'release_0_9_4'.

	* [r7471] /tags/LATEST_STABLE, /tags/LATEST_STABLE/facespace:
	  This commit was manufactured by cvs2svn to create tag
	  'LATEST_STABLE'.

2007-12-30  ceball

	* [r7470] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Note to myself.

	* [r7469] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Added 'bothmethod' decorator (c.f. 'classmethod'). Use bothmethod
	  to decorate force_new_dynamic_value(), inspect_value(), and
	  repr_value() so that all three can be called on both instances
	  and classes. (Fixes missing functionality that was most obvious
	  in the model editor: couldn't add new sheets.)

	* [r7468] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Made some of Dynamic's __get__-related method signatures match
	  Parameter's __get__ better. Not really an important change. The
	  place to read about the confusion is Parameter.__get__ itself.

	* [r7467] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Added ALERT (might not actually be ALERT, but at least needs some
	  documentation).

	* [r7466] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Added topo.sim.run(0) call to Present() (because it push()es the
	  simulation state). Fixes failing TestPattern test.

	* [r7465] topo/tests/gui_tests.py:
	  Added TestPattern Present-before-simulation-run test (currently
	  fails).

	* [r7464] topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Removed 'fake' hack; pattern_present calls run(0.0) before doing
	  anything else, instead.

	* [r7463] topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  pusgh_input_generator now puts the current input_generator on the
	  stack and leaves a *copy* in place.

	* [r7462] topo/tests/test_pattern_present.txt:
	  Added test to show bug in save_input_generators()
	  (GeneratorSheet's push_input_generator).

	* [r7461] topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  Fixed bug in error message.

2007-12-29  ceball

	* [r7460] topo/tests/setup_simulation.py:
	  Specify sheet bounds because the defaults are overridden in other
	  tests.

	* [r7459] topo/tests/testboundingregion.py:
	  Removed stray blank line.

	* [r7458] topo/tests/testoutputfnsoptimized.py:
	  Added HACKALERT.

	* [r7457] topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py:
	  Stopped tests running twice by correcting class hierarchy.

	* [r7456] topo/tests/testbitmap.jpg:
	  Reduced size to 100x55 to speed up unit tests.

	* [r7455] topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py:
	  No change - marginal speedup by reducing density.

	* [r7454] Makefile,
	  topo/tests/lissom_oo_or.ty_pickle_test.typ:
	  Added snapshot-compatibility-test (and added it to slow-tests).
	  Not yet going to guarantee snapshots will keep working, but at
	  least we'll know when we break them. The snapshot comes from
	  current CVS. (Might want to add more snapshots from other
	  examples in the future.)

	* [r7453] topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Added flag to run() so that pattern_present can avoid clearing
	  out the list of eps to start (with ALERT). Fixes failing test
	  test_pattern_present (or it would, but the test itself has a bug
	  that causes it to fail when run with make tests - on its own it
	  now passes fine.

	* [r7452] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated cvs2svn procedure (diff command for checking).

	* [r7451] /trunk/facespace/__init__.py:
	  Fixed up some strange line endings (most were fine - seems odd).

	* [r7450] topo/tests/test_pattern_present.txt:
	  Removed mistaken line (that's not testing anything).

	* [r7449] doc/Downloads/cygwin_packages:
	  Converted to unix format using dos2unix. Unix format is fine if
	  we handle this file in Cygwin on Windows.

	* [r7448] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updates to cvs2svn procedure (checking svn matches cvs).

	* [r7447] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Fixed typos: options were in wrong place.

	* [r7446] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Update to cvs2svn procedure (svn:eol=native).

	* [r7445] topo/tests/test_pattern_present.txt:
	  Inserted pattern_present() before any topo.sim.run(); test now
	  fails.

	* [r7444] topo/tests/test_pattern_present.txt:
	  Clarified test. Currently passes. pattern_present() bug is when
	  it's called before time is advanced at all.

	* [r7443] topo/tests/test_pattern_present.txt:
	  Initial version. Shows problem with pattern_present().

	* [r7442] topo/tests/setup_simulation.py:
	  Initial version.

2007-12-28  ceball

	* [r7441] external,
	  external/.cvsignore,
	  external/Makefile:
	  Roll back to Python 2.4.

	* [r7440] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Make ParamOverrides compatible with python 2.4.

	* [r7439] topo/tkgui/topowidgets.py,
	  topo/tkgui/widgets.py:
	  Moved ResizableScrollableFrame into the same place as the windows
	  themselves (so all the code that could be replaced is together).

	* [r7438] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updates to cvs2svn procedure.

	* [r7437] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  When changing sheet, update the widget's list now that the option
	  menu is editable (rather than replacing the whole widget). Fixes
	  failing test test_projection in gui_tests.

	* [r7436] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added update_selector(). String_ObjectTranslators replace their
	  caches on update().

	* [r7435] topo/tkgui/widgets.py:
	  Addded replace_list() to EditableOptionMenu.

	* [r7434] topo/tests/gui_tests.py:
	  Update test_projection to swtich sheets and projections.

	* [r7433] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  set_parameter_value() updates the corresponding tkvar, and
	  __setattr__ uses set_parameter_value() to set parameter values.
	  Grouped related methods together.

	* [r7432] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed 'param_has_modifyable_choices'.

	* [r7431] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Reverted to version 1.160 - the previous checkin was accidental.

2007-12-27  ceball

	* [r7430] topo/tests/gui_tests.py:
	  Added test that shows changing sheet on projection window is not
	  working.

	* [r7429] topo/tests/functionaltest.py:
	  Added further check to catch errors.

	* [r7428] topo/tests/gui_tests.py:
	  Create a more complex simulation.

	* [r7427] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Update to cvs2svn procedure.

	* [r7426] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Update to cvs2svn procedure.

	* [r7425] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Update to cvs2svn procedure.

	* [r7424] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated cvs2svn procedure.

2007-12-24  jbednar

	* [r7423] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Fixed typo

2007-12-23  ceball

	* [r7422] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Enable warnings for code using old DynamicNumber-in-a-Number
	  syntax.

	* [r7421] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_od.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or_dy.ty,

	  examples/sullivan_nn06.ty,
	  examples/tiny.ty,
	  topo/tests/testCompositePatternGenerators.txt,
	  topo/tests/testDynamicParameter.txt:
	  Removed old DynamicNumber-in-a-Number syntax.

	* [r7420] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Renamed 'pos' to 'params' (ParamOverrides) and fixed some missing
	  calls to ParamOverrides (some PatternGenerators have no test
	  coverage).

	* [r7419] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Added ALERT.

	* [r7418]
	  examples/sullivan_neurocomputing04.ty,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/patterns/image.py,
	  topo/patterns/random.py,
	  topo/patterns/rds.py,
	  topo/patterns/teststimuli.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Renamed 'pos' to 'params' (ParamOverrides).

	* [r7417] examples/joublin_bc96.ty:
	  Use ParamOverrides in the PatternGenerator.

	* [r7416] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added task.

	* [r7415] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added step to cvs2svn procedure.

	* [r7414] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Fix a bug in panels when __update_widgets_for_history() is
	  called: sometimes setting a widget's state fails (not sure why).

2007-12-22  ceball

	* [r7413]
	  examples/sullivan_neurocomputing04.ty:
	  Revert to dynamic parameters not controlled by simulation time
	  (need to investigate this script).

	* [r7412] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Removed unused import and ALERT that was fixed.

	* [r7411] topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py:
	  Updated test for time-controlled dynamic parameters.

	* [r7410]
	  topo/tests/testCompositeParameter.txt:
	  Removed test that is no longer meaningful (with time-controlled
	  dynamic parameters).

	* [r7409] topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Switched to time-controlled Dynamic Parameters.

	* [r7408]
	  topo/tests/testCompositePatternGenerators.txt:
	  Removed outdated comments.

	* [r7407] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Cleanup of Dynamic-related methods; should be no visible change.

	* [r7406] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed '_dynamically_generated' slot from Dynamic.

	* [r7405] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Dynamic's last time and last value are stored on the generator
	  rather than the Parameter/ParameterizedObject. (Working, but
	  needs to be cleaned up.)

	* [r7404] topo/tests/testDynamicParameter.txt:
	  Commented out test for generators and iterators; we don't (yet)
	  support those.

	* [r7403]
	  topo/tests/testCompositeParameter.txt:
	  Replaced iter as a Dynamic value with a class (no change to
	  test). Note that although the previous version worked before,
	  using iter does not work in general (e.g. for the default value,
	  or when pickling).

2007-12-21  ceball

	* [r7402] topo/tests/testDynamicParameter.txt:
	  Corrections to previous commit (don't change failure outcome).

2007-12-20  ceball

	* [r7401] topo/tests/testDynamicParameter.txt:
	  Test shared generator and some common generator types. (Test now
	  fails.)

2007-12-19  jbednar

	* [r7400] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added info about PsychoPy and VisionEgg

2007-12-18  jbednar

	  Minor fix to docstrings

2007-12-18  ceball

	  Stop Composite and subclasses causing unused dynamic parameter
	  value accesses.

	  topo/patterns/basic.py,
	  topo/tests/cfsom_or.ty_DATA,

	  topo/tests/lissom_or.ty_DATA,
	  topo/tests/lissom_or_homeomaxent.ty_DATA,
	  topo/tests/lissom_or_noshrinking.ty_DATA:
	  Stop Composite and subclasses causing unused dynamic parameter
	  value accesses.

	* [r7396] external,
	  external/.cvsignore:
	  Changed to Python-2.5.1

	* [r7395]

	  topo/patterns/image.py,
	  topo/patterns/random.py,
	  topo/patterns/rds.py,
	  topo/patterns/teststimuli.py:
	  Replaced params.get('x',self.x) with ParamOverrides. Some
	  variables will need to be renamed to improve clarity, and the
	  code should be tidied in several places. Should be no visible
	  change (unless maybe someone whose code is not checked in was
	  using a (Separated)Composite with a subpattern that had
	  previously undetected duplicate 'params.get()' lines causing two
	  unused advances of dynamic numbers - which is unlikely).

	* [r7394] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Make ParamOverrides simulate old params.get('x',self.x) behavior
	  by accessing an attribute (which causes random numbers to be
	  skipped) if the overridden object is a PatternGenerator belonging
	  to Composite.

	* [r7393] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/tests/testParamOverrides.txt:
	  Changed to pass a dict to ParamOverrides.

	* [r7392] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/tests/testParamOverrides.txt:
	  Initial version of ParamOverrides.

2007-12-17  jprovost

	* [r7390] topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  Added outputfn support ot GeneratorSheets.

	* [r7389] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Made 'topographica -i <file>' stay open at a command prompt when
	  there's an error in <file>.

	  Tests for CompositeSheetMasks.

	* [r7386] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Added CompositeSheetMask, AndMask, and OrMask.

2007-12-16  ceball

	  Build test now runs unit tests too.

	* [r7383] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated cvs2svn conversion procedure.

	* [r7382] doc/buildbot/index.html:

	* [r7381] doc/Downloads/cvs_text.php:
	  Minor simplification.

	* [r7380] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:
	  Removed prefix. Directories in changes should show up ok because
	  I patched
	  /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/buildbot/changes/mail.py.

2007-12-15  jbednar

	* [r7379] topo/outputfns/__init__.py:
	  Added auto-import from basic.py, to simplify access for common
	  items

	* [r7378] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Added declaration of __all__ to provide a clean 'from x import *'

2007-12-15  ceball

	* [r7377] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:
	  Tried a new prefix for mail source.

	* [r7376] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:

	* [r7375] doc/Downloads/cvs_text.php:
	  Added links to build status.

	* [r7374] doc/Downloads/cvs_text.php:
	  Added links to specific builders (to see status of latest cvs
	  version.

	* [r7373] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Removed commented-out 'plot gallery' code.

2007-12-14  ceball

	* [r7372] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:
	  Updated to buildbot-0.7.6 format. Added beginnings of Windows
	  tester. Changed to better html status. Max of 1 buildbot action
	  at any one time on sake and doozy. Separated gui-tests. Only
	  emails when the status changes from pass to fail. If make fails,
	  the subsequent tests are skipped. OS X built for Aqua.

	* [r7371] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Quick fix to Defaults button (fixes failing gui test).

	* [r7370] topo/tests/gui_tests.py:
	  Fixed error in test_test_pattern() (no visible change - test was
	  correctly failing).

	* [r7369] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  No visible change: method changed from __ to _.

	* [r7368] topo/tests/testDynamicParameter.txt:
	  Removed ParameterizedObject.is_dynamically_generated.

	* [r7367] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed ParameterizedObject.is_dynamically_generated.

	* [r7366] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Clarified a comment.

	* [r7365] topo/tests/functionaltest.py,
	  topo/tests/gui_tests.py:
	  Moved the test 'framework' into a separate file. (Not sure if it
	  will ever be helpful other than for gui_tests...)

	* [r7364] topo/tests/gui_tests.py:
	  No visible change: moved titling into _run().

	* [r7363] topo/tests/gui_tests.py:
	  Moved comments into assertion statements to improve output.

	* [r7362] Makefile:
	  For GUI tests, return the number of errors.

	* [r7361] topo/tests/gui_tests.py:
	  Added a simple framework to make running gui tests simpler, and

	* [r7357] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/tests/testparameterizedobject.py:
	  Fixed bug in ParameterizedObject.params(), where the params cache
	  for a class could hide the parameters of its superclasses (i.e.
	  the bug preventing Connection Fields windows from opening through
	  a right click.) Added test of params().

	* [r7349] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Intermediate checkin (anticipates some changes for when Dynamic
	  uses topo.sim.time() but doesn't change any current results).
	  Dynamic caches whether or not its value is being dynamically
	  generated; Parameter caches internal_name; added
	  force_new_dynamic_value() to ParameterizedObject;

	  initial normalization step

	* [r7344] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py:
	  Changed ScalingOF and JointScalingOF to calculate scaling factor
	  with old average. Corrected JointScalingOF to scale individual

	  replaced turning learning flag off in pattern_present with
	  calling stop_updating() and restore_updating()

	  __repr__).

	* [r7329] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Added some comments.

	* [r7328] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:

	  method.

	* [r7327] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:

	  Minor cleanup - should be no changes to behavior.

2007-12-07  ceball

2007-12-07  rczhao

	* [r7316] external/Makefile:
	  Rolled back to older version of pytables as the latest version
	  2.0.2 doesn't work for numpy 1.0.2 currently installed on
	  Topographica

	* [r7315] external/pytables-20070518.tar.gz:

	  changed plot_values to be compatible with new
	  ValueTrackingOutputFn

	* [r7260] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py:

	  values for debugging. Added AvgScalingOutputFn which keeps track
	  of average activities and calculates scaling factor for
	  homeostatic scaling

	* [r7259] topo/commands/pylabplots.py:
	  Added plot_values function for plotting or saving time series
	  data from output functions

2007-12-03  jbednar

	* [r7258] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py:
	  Untested cleanup; should work the same as the previous revision

2007-12-03  judelaw

	* [r7257] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py:
	  Cleaned up OutputFnDebugger, removed plotting imports

2007-12-02  ceball

	* [r7256] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Added commented-out lines to set Dynamic's time_fn.

	* [r7255] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Demo code to allow us to try Dynamic parameters that only advance
	  once per simulation time. (Actually the time_fn can be any
	  function.) Needs pretty big cleanup if we decide to keep this.

	* [r7254] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed code to look for a parameter object in a
	  ParameterizedObject instance's dict, since Dynamic parameters are
	  not longer stored that way (i.e. no more DynamicNumber inside a
	  Number).

	* [r7253] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Moved ParameterizedObjectMetaclass.print_param_defaults() to
	  ParameterizedObject (as a classmethod).

	* [r7252] examples/hierarchical.ty:
	  classparams() is now just params().

	* [r7251] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  No longer need to distinguish classparams() and params().

	* [r7250] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed ParameterizedObjectMetaclass.classparams() and made
	  ParameterizedObject.params() be a classmethod.

	* [r7249] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Updates to match changes to Dynamic.

	* [r7248] topo/tests/testDynamicParameter.txt:
	  Tests use Dynamic rather than Number. Changed tests to reflect
	  possible instantiation of Dynamic parameters.

	* [r7247] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Minor updates to match changes to Dynamic. Added some (unrelated)
	  comments.

	* [r7246] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  (Intermediate checkin.) Dynamic parameters have instantiate set
	  to True if created with a dynamic default value. (No-effect
	  'update_fn' added, too, because some reorganization got mixed up
	  with fixing instantiation.)

2007-12-01  ceball

	* [r7245] Makefile:
	  Added gui-tests target.

	* [r7244] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:

	  Added test to show bug in current Dynamic parameter
	  implementation.

	* [r7242] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Added ERRORALERT about Dynamic's _dynamic slot.

	* [r7241] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Use EditableOptionMenu instead of OptionMenu (though not yet
	  taking advantage of the editable list). Added gui_set_param() and
	  gui_get_param() methods.

	* [r7240] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Changed 'present' parameter to 'Present' for consistency. (I have
	  been naming ButtonParameters with a capital letter, but will
	  probably revert them all to lowercase sometime soon.)

	* [r7239] topo/tkgui/widgets.py:
	  Added get() and set() to EditableOptionMenu (for consistency with
	  other widgets).

	* [r7238] topo/tests/testparametersframe.py:
	  The OptionMenu we use now has get().

	* [r7237] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Added ALERT about topographica not staying open.

	* [r7236] Makefile:
	  Use gui_tests.py for running the GUI tests. Added
	  detailed-gui-tests target.

	* [r7235] topo/tests/gui_tests.py:
	  Initial version. run_detailed() fails right now because it shows
	  a test pattern bug.

	  Cleaned up docs and whitespace

	* [r7229] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py:
	  Made OutputFnDebugger have a default function of None, so that
	  non-existing parameters will generate errors. Merged its
	  debug_dict and avg_dict, in preparation for defining a standard
	  interface and separating plotting out

	* [r7228] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py:
	  Removed stray unused function

	* [r7227] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py:
	  Merged save_debug_graphs into plot_debug_graphs, making
	  plot_debug_graphs save to disk if an optional filename parameter

	* [r7226] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py:
	  Simplified OutputFnDebugger by eliminating duplicate for loops

	* [r7225] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py:

	* [r7220] topo/tkgui/__init__.py:
	  Added option to suppress printing 'Launching GUI'.

	* [r7219] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Reorganized so that tests no longer run identically twice (should

	  'slice' was being used as a variable name. Added a little
	  documentation

	* [r7211] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Tried to simplify and document inspect_value() and repr_value().
	  Should be no visible change.

	* [r7210]
	  topo/tests/testCompositeParameter.txt:

	  on a class.

	* [r7201] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Added ERRORALERT.

	* [r7200] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Fixed bug in repr_value() where dynamic values were being
	  advanced (dict.get default value is looked up even if not being
	  used). (Same bug existed in the past, but that was caused by
	  Parameter instances sharing last_value.)

	* [r7199] topo/tests/__init__.py:
	  Small cleanup of run_named().

	* [r7198] topo/tests/testcfsom.py,
	  topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py,
	  topo/tests/testpatternpresent.py,
	  topo/tests/testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  No longer uses DynamicNumber to wrap a number generator.

	* [r7197] topo/outputfns/basic.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py,
	  topo/tests/testDynamicParameter.txt:
	  Change from DynamicNumber to Number.

	* [r7196] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Updated documentation regarding Dynamic parameters.

	* [r7195] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Turn of warnings about changed Dynamic parameters for the moment.

	* [r7194] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Fixed minor typo.

	* [r7193] examples/hierarchical.ty:
	  Updated to use dynamic Number rather than DynamicNumber (as first
	  example of how syntax changes).

	* [r7192] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Removed unused import.

	* [r7191] topo/tests/testDynamicParameter.txt:
	  Suppress Dynamic warnings and show that DynamicNumber declared in
	  a class by adding doc string.

	* [r7190] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Some reorganization and support for regridding a parameter.
	  Intermediate checkin.

	* [r7189] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Updates for changes to Dynamic and DynamicNumber. Added
	  repack_param() (untested). Intermediate checkin, but Dynamic
	  parameters are working (not all features can be invoked
	  graphically yet).

	* [r7188] topo/plotting/palette.py:
	  Replaced lambda-in-a-parameter with a callable class. (Dynamic
	  parameters are always instantiated.)

	* [r7187] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Updated inspect_value() with changes to Dynamic parameters. Added
	  repr_value() (name to be changed) to return the value of a
	  parameter in a form that allows the parameter to be recreated.
	  New Dynamic-support code not yet finished, but appears to be
	  working so far.

	* [r7186] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Updated Dynamic: has _dynamic and last_value slots. _dynamic is
	  set to True if the Dynamic's value is callable or is an iterator
	  (i.e. is dynamic). A Dynamic Parameter's last_value is stored
	  inside the Parameter itself when the Parameter is only set on the
	  class, but is stored as _X_param_value_last in the owning
	  *object* if the Parameter's value has been set on the object
	  (might not be final). Number now inherits from Dynamic. If Number
	  is set to a dynamic value, the bounds are checked at __get__ time
	  rather than at __set__ time (which is what happens for
	  non-dynamic values). Replaced DynamicNumber with a dummy that
	  fills the two previous (distinct) uses (i.e. it replaces class
	  Parameter declarations of DynamicNumber with Number, and it
	  replaces using DynamicNumber to wrap number generators as values
	  for Number parameters). New Dynamic code not yet finished, but
	  appears to be working so far.

	* [r7094] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py,

	  Removed TkPOTaggedSlider (does nothing more than TaggedSlider).

	* [r7093] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Fixed bug with history mechanism: plotgroup now added to history
	  whenever refresh_plots() called, and is only added if there are
	  actually plots.

	* [r7092] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Added note for myself.

	* [r7091] topo/misc/commandline.py:

	  start() prints 'Launching GUI' message.

	* [r7089] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Make sure IPython quits when topographica not started for

	  Added note.

	* [r7086] topo/tests/testparametersframe.py,

	* [r7084] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Updates to match tkparameterizedobject.py 1.117.

	* [r7083] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Improvements to Parameter-Tkinter linkage.
	
	  Major:
	  - unapplied changes to parameter values are indicated with blue
	  labels
	  - parameters that are not set to class defaults have a green
	  label background
	  - an error in a parameter value is indicated with red labels
	  (note that the above indication styles are temporary)
	
	  Minor:
	  - fixed _get_tk_val to return gui variable value
	  - no attempt to set Parameter if string-to-value translation
	  fails
	
	  Internal:
	  - simplified handling of GUI editing of variables
	  - translation code moved from TkParameterizedObjectBase to
	  separate classes
	  - renamed tk_var to tkvar
	  - renamed object2string_ifrequired to _object2string
	  - renamed string2object_ifrequired to _string2object
	  (also added some debug messages)

	* [r7082] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Added support for pickling GenericImage (PIL's Image cannot be
	  pickled).

	* [r7081] Makefile:
	  (topographica script) Start ipython as in bin/ipython.

	* [r7080] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Removed import of weave (was originally required for Windows
	  version, but seems no longer to be needed).

2007-11-16  jbednar

2007-11-15  jbednar

	  Added values() method to match a regular dictionary

	* [r7074] topo/commands/pylabplots.py:

2007-11-15  ceball

	* [r7071] topo/tests/testparametersframe.py,
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Starting tkgui when this test is imported causes problems if
	  there's no DISPLAY. Only need to start tkgui if the test is run
	  alone, so having the code isn't important anyway (can just pass
	  -g).

	  Cleaned up decode_feature

	* [r7069] topo/base/simulation.py,

2007-11-13  jbednar

	* [r7060] topo/misc/commandline.py:

2007-11-13  ceball

	* [r7059] Makefile:
	  (topographica script) Make IPython's user namespace be __main__.

	* [r7058] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Do set Simulation name if one is passed to Simulation.__init__.

	* [r7055] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Removed apparently out-of-date ALERT.

	* [r7054] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Renamed sim_title_from_filename to sim_name_from_filename.

	* [r7053] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Automatic simulation naming now takes account of filenames
	  supplied *before* the first commandline option. (Also: renamed
	  sim_title_from_filename to sim_name_from_filename; renamed
	  get_filenames to get_postoption_filenames.

	* [r7052] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Minor change to code style - no visible change.

	* [r7051] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Moved execution of startup file(s) into a function, and made two
	  changes: (1) 'Executing startup file...' message printed whether
	  option.interactive/gui or not (although if not interactive, print

	  Added comment to ALERT about weave on Windows.

	* [r7049] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Commented out print statement (otherwise, if you pass -g at the

	  Removed erroneous example of not needing a Connection Fields
	  plot.

	* [r7045] examples/saccade_demo.ty:
	  Updated to support image sequences in ShiftingGeneratorSheet.

	  import problems (when trying to use topo.tkgui from several of
	  the files in topo/tkgui, get 'module does not contain tkgui'
	  attribute error). (2) Moved 'entry background hack to
	  topowidgets.py. (3) Made start() return immediately if a console

	  Added some notes.

	* [r7025]

	  TestPattern windows no longer all share the same PlotGroup (a
	  bug). Renamed TestPattern's PlotGroup to 'Test Pattern' (from

	  PlotMatrixPanels only redraw when the sheet changes (previously

	  update_maximum_plot_height() handles the case where there are no
	  resizeable plots. Probably needs correcting.

	  Don't plot projection plots immediately.

	  external/pybwidget-0.1.2_1.8.0.tar.gz:
	  Reverted to previous gzip'd version of tar now windows'
	  python_topo/ has been built. No idea why the gzip'd version is
	  incompatible between linux and Windows (linux gzip'd one won't
	  gunzip on Windows; Windows gzip'd one won't gunzip on linux).

	* [r6936]
	  external/pybwidget-0.1.2_1.8.0.tar.gz:
	  Same tar file as before, but gzip'd on Windows since I couldn't
	  get the original one to gunzip on Windows.

	* [r6932] doc/shared/index.php:

	  flickering on in Windows.

	* [r6913] topo/tkgui/widgets.py:
	  Stop buttons having black outline when mouse moves over them
	  (since it doesn't go away until another widget's clicked on).

	* [r6912] topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Ask that sheet/projection which is top after sorting is selected
	  by default.

	* [r6911] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Allow to request a new default value when packing a parameter.

	* [r6910] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Undo a previous change: gui should not change value of all
	  SelectorParameters to the item with the highest precedence. (Need
	  to alter so it's only done for GUI parameters.)

	* [r6909] topo/tkgui/widgets.py:
	  Added test for OSX to manual control of scrollbars (manual
	  control doesn't work on OSX and isn't needed).

	* [r6908] topo/tkgui/widgets.py:
	  Added commented-out line that (when uncommented) makes scrollbars

	  topo/tkgui/topowidgets.py,
	  topo/tkgui/widgets.py:

	* [r6896] topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py:
	  Removed unused import.

	* [r6895] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Don't copy the plotgroup in save_plotgroup() (at least until the
	  filesaver attribute is changed from an object to just the class,
	  for instantiation later - or some other correction is made).

	* [r6894] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Disable plotgroups saving (still more problems pickling
	  plotgroup.

	* [r6893] topo/commands/analysis.py:

	  now).

	* [r6892] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Store plotgroups with snapshots now problems have been fixed.

	* [r6891] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  When saving a plotgroup, work on a copy of the original from

	  Panels take a *copy* of a plotgroup from plotgroups, rather than
	  the original object.

	* [r6889] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Temporarily disabled plotgroups saving (since plotgroups
	  themselves actually won't pickle).

	  Removed unnecessary try/except.

	* [r6885] topo/tkgui/widgets.py:
	  Made TaggedSlider's config() method return the correct type (but
	  needs to return the correct thing eventually).

	* [r6884] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Use FocusTakingButton rather than Button so that any non-button
	  widget correctly receives <FocusOut> if a button is clicked.

	* [r6883] topo/tkgui/widgets.py:
	  Added FocusTakingButton.

	* [r6882] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:

	  Save plotgroups when pickling.

	* [r6879] topo/commands/basic.py,
	  topo/misc/utils.py:
	  Added ExtraPickler to allow module-level attributes to be pickled
	  (specifically, lets us save plotgroups repository). Might not be
	  the best way to do this.

	* [r6878] topo/misc/keyedlist.py:
	  Fixed typo.

	* [r6877] topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py:

	  Made projection name match other simulations

2007-10-17  ceball

	* [r6853] topo/tkgui/topowidgets.py:

	  Use sheet's closest_cell_center() method rather than separate
	  calls to sheet2matrixidx and matrixidx2sheet.

	* [r6844] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Change format of unit coordinates in rf plot so they show up as
	  more than (0,0).

	  Fixed error in previous checkin.

	* [r6839] topo/commands/analysis.py:

	  Renamed sheet_view_dict to sheet_views.

	* [r6835] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Added in sheet and input_sheet arguments to RFCOG code.
	  measure_rfcof() prints a warning if measure_rfs() hasn't been
	  called before (i.e. if the right views don't exist).

	* [r6834] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Added RF CoG plot code: doesn't seem to crash, but untested other
	  than that.

	* [r6833] topo/base/sheetcoords.py:
	  Fixed error in closest_cell_center().

	* [r6832] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Minor cleanup of hierarchy.

	* [r6831] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Moved situate code to CFProjectionPanel, since ProjectionPanel

	  Added task

	* [r6816] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed integer_scaling and sheet_coords to simply scale without

	  Minor updates to comments and error checking

	* [r6814] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:

2007-10-15  jbednar

	* [r6807] topo/base/projection.py,
	  topo/base/simulation.py,

	  doc/User_Manual/time_text.php:
	  Added documentation for min_print_level

	* [r6804] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:

	  RFProjectionPlotGroup.

	* [r6797] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py,
	  topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  First pass at integrating reverse-correlation RF measurement:
	  removed topo.analysis.featureresponses.grid dictionary, instead

2007-10-15  jbednar

	* [r6796] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/base/simulation.py:

	  Removed unused import

	* [r6793] topo/misc/keyedlist.py:
	  Made keys of None work for [] accessing, fixing problem with
	  'make
	  slow-tests'. Moved integer indexing code from get() to
	  __getitem__,
	  because that's presumably how it would be used (as in list[4]).
	  Added
	  a print statement to find out if that code is ever called; it
	  doesn't
	  seem necessary.

	* [r6785] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Raise exception if there's nothing by that name for
	  projections(name), to avoid silent errors

	  Moved file path code to topo.misc.filepaths. Renamed
	  resolve_filename to resolve_path.

	* [r6778] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Capture stdout from run_batch. Catch errors in what run_batch
	  executes, and write them to the output file (warning at the
	  console). Also stores command used to start topographica.

	* [r6777] topo/commands/analysis.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py:

	  turn off the scrollbars. Also revert to previous size hack of 19.
	  (Intermediate checkin.)

	* [r6723] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  normalize_path now uses the output_path as a prefix unless it is
	  specified in the arguments

	* [r6722] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  The run_batch function was completely rewritten, number of small
	  bugs corrected. The main change is that now it uses the
	  normalized_path interface to control the location where the
	  output of the simulation is being saved

	* [r6721] topo/commands/basic.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:

	  ideal size straightaway.

	* [r6709] topo/tkgui/topowidgets.py:
	  Finally found how to determine if the scrollbars are really
	  needed, and to fake a click on the scrollbar. Scrollbars no
	  longer hang around on linux when not required. Need to check OS X
	  and Windows still work ok.

	* [r6708] topo/tests/testplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Don't start the gui unless there's a display. All subject to an
	  ALERT.

2007-10-08  jbednar

	* [r6655] doc/Makefile:
	  Skipped removing the reference manual so that it will be in the
	  distribution

	* [r6654] Makefile:
	  Removed mistaken change

	* [r6653] Makefile,
	  examples/README.txt:

	  Minor cleanup to TkguiWindow.

	* [r6626] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Remove Filename's requirement that a path is valid on __set__().

	* [r6625] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Update method name to match change to tkparameterizedobject.

	* [r6624] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Cleanup (mainly to documentation, but also to order methods are
	  written in the file, and some _/__ changes) - should be no
	  visible change.

	* [r6623] doc/User_Manual/plotting_text.php,
	  examples/lissom_whisker_barrels.ty,
	  topo/commands/analysis.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:

2007-10-06  ceball

	* [r6622] topo/misc/utils.py,
	  topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Moved inverse() from topo.tkgui.tkparameterizedobject to

	* [r6619] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:

	  Removed hack that's no longer necessary (Filename parameter now
	  returns the correct path (i.e. the path corrected for platform
	  and to be absolute) on __get__()).

	* [r6617] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Fixed previous commit so that help menu items work if local
	  documentation not already built.

	* [r6616] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:

	  that it handles any necessary filepath correction.

	* [r6611] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topowidgets.py:
	  Use abs_app_path.

	* [r6610] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Minor syntax adjustment.

	* [r6609] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Added abs_app_path(), which used to be __construct_path() in
	  Filename parameter. Filename parameter now uses abs_app_path().
	  Change to Filename parameter is that it now produces the correct
	  path on __get__(), allowing parameters where the paths were
	  created on Windows to be transferred to linux (in a snapshot).
	  This means calling abs_app_path() more often (every __get__())
	  instead of just on __set__().

	  topo/tests/testplotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py,

	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Removed PlotGroupTemplate.

	* [r6509] topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Removed PlotGroupTemplate. Fixed strength-only button (ugly, but
	  it seems to work...).

	* [r6508] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  (Multiple changes) (1) Removed PlotGroupTemplate. (2) Removed
	  CFPGPanel; situate button code copied into classes that need it.

	* [r6507] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Commented out all code. Features moved to TemplatePlotGroup (but
	  need to adapt documentation).

	* [r6506] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  (Multiple changes) (1) Some tidying of PlotGroup classes (removed
	  some code duplication, began to modify to the hierarchy of
	  classes). (2) Removed PlotGroupTemplate: TemplatePlotGroup gets
	  PlotGroupTemplate's Parameters and methods, with minor
	  modifications.

	* [r6505] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Removed PlotGroupTemplate: new_pgt() is replaced with new_pg().

2007-09-23  ceball

	* [r6504] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed worst part of Entry background hack: Tkinter has
	  'systemWindowBody' background color.

	* [r6503] topo/tkgui/__init__.py,
	  topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Moved entry background color hack back to tkparameterizedobject
	  from __init__. Now the tests pass ok. There is a mysterious
	  import problem somewhere in tkgui (as noted in tkguiwindow.py).

2007-09-22  ceball

	* [r6502] doc/User_Manual/modeleditor_text.php:
	  Updated some text in ParametersFrame section.

	* [r6501] doc/User_Manual/commandline_text.php:
	  Added example of edit_parameters().

	* [r6500] doc/User_Manual/modeleditor_text.php:
	  Corrected anchor.

	* [r6499] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Updated comments related to ButtonParameter image size: presuming
	  different units for the button size depending on whether it's
	  showing text or an image is a Tkinter feature.

	* [r6498] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Change ButtonParameter to use size rather than image_size. Sizing
	  of ButtonParameters is not quite finished yet.

	* [r6497] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added image support to ButtonParameter.

	* [r6496] topo/tkgui/__init__.py,
	  topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Made the entry highlighting hack at least blend in with the
	  background color.

	* [r6495] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Fixed bug where an old method name was not being overidden in a
	  subclass. Need to update all these old names in callers, once the
	  names are cleaned up. Removed some commented-out code.

	* [r6494] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  When instantiating a Parameter, if that Parameter is a PO, make
	  it uninitialized while a new name is set.

	* [r6493] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Made EventProcessor's name be constant.

	* [r6492] topo/tests/testparametersframe.py:
	  Updates to match name changes in ParametersFrame.

	* [r6491] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Cleanup of some names.

	* [r6490] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  (Multiple changes.) (1) Fixed bug (line 1087) where, on opening
	  the model editor or test pattern window, there was an error about
	  attempting to set a CallableParameter to a string. (2) Added
	  get_source_po() method to allow simplification of several others.
	  (3) Returned repr to the previous simple version, since the new
	  one still does not work properly.

2007-09-21  ceball

	* [r6489] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Hide the Refresh button, since it's extremely unlikely anyone
	  will be editing the PatternGenerator on the commandline.

	* [r6488] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Corrected mistake with set_PO() method present in
	  LiveParametersFrame and ParametersFrame.

	* [r6487] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Added a basic repr method to InstanceMethodWrapper.

	* [r6486] doc/User_Manual/commandline_text.php:
	  Minor update to text.

	* [r6485] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Cleaned up ButtonParameter handling. Now the command of a button
	  of x named 'Button' can be invoked as x.Button(). Made a
	  reasonable (but not perfect) repr method. hide_param() and
	  unhide_param() just do nothing if the parameter is already hidden
	  or already displayed, respectively.

	* [r6484] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Minor cleanup.

	* [r6483] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Added some links discussing button order.

	* [r6482] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Clean up of Apply, Refresh, Close, and Defaults buttons.

	* [r6481] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added a note.

	* [r6480] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Defaults button now works in test pattern, so enable it.

	* [r6479] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Updated to use ParameterizedObject's defaults() method when
	  Defaults button is pressed.

	* [r6478] topo/tests/testparametersframe.py:
	  Added note.

	* [r6477] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Replaced reset_params() with defaults(), which returns default
	  values for non-constant parameters.

2007-09-18  jprovost

	* [r6476] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  This change got the projections panel to stop raising exceptions
	  when encountering non-CF Projections, but it still doesn't really
	  work right.

	* [r6475] topo/sheets/saccade.py:
	  Added support for eye jitter in ShiftingGeneratorSheet

2007-09-18  ceball

	* [r6474] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:

	* [r6473] topo/tests/testparametersframe.py:
	  Added another test.

	* [r6472] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Fixed mistake causing test failure in testparametersframe: was
	  converting to string twice.

	* [r6471] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Minor reorganization.

	* [r6470] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  More cleanup: should be no visible change.

	* [r6469] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Cleanup: should be no visible change.

	* [r6468] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:

	* [r6467] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Minor cleanup: should be no visible change.

	* [r6465] topo/misc/traces.py:
	  Miscellaneous minor improvements.

	* [r6464] topo/misc/commandline.py:

	  doesn't work that great, though.

2007-09-16  ceball

	* [r6463] topo/tests/testparametersframe.py:
	  Added new test to expose bug. Renamed the other test method.

	* [r6462] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added notes. Test for guimain (hack).

	* [r6461] topo/tests/testparametersframe.py:
	  Added test.

	* [r6460] topo/tkgui/tkguiwindow.py:
	  Added get() method to taggedslider (to match other widgets).

	* [r6459] topo/tests/testparametersframe.py:
	  Initial version.

	* [r6458] Makefile:
	  Added gui test: that connection fields window opens with x and y
	  as specified (i.e. test that right click opening of connection
	  fields window is working).

	* [r6457] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Switched run_for_var to DoubleVar. Get 'run for' value from
	  variable rather than widget.

	* [r6456] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Multiple improvements to behavior. Entry-style widgets do not
	  instantly apply their changes (waiting instead until <Return> or
	  equivalent). Corrected already noted instance of not using
	  object2string_ifrequired(). Added highlighting of entry boxes
	  with errors (experimental, unfinished). Fixed bug where only text
	  widgets were being disabled for constant parameters.

	* [r6455] topo/tkgui/tkguiwindow.py:
	  Improved TaggedSlider: removed a variable and its trace, and made
	  it generate events for use by callers. Added
	  TkPOTaggedSlider(TaggedSlider) for TkParameterizedObject-specific
	  features.

	* [r6454] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Added missing method call.

	* [r6453]
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added more tests to simulate use in the GUI.

	  fonts etc).

2007-09-14  ceball

	* [r6445]
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Commented out code that conditionally starts tkgui - still causes
	  problems with other tests.

	* [r6444]
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Start()s tkgui if console not already present. Added more tests.
	  The tests in TestParameterTypeRepresentations define how we
	  expect the widgets to behave; they simulate user input to the
	  widgets.

2007-09-12  jbednar

	* [r6443] doc/Downloads/cvs_text.php:

2007-09-12  ceball

	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Cleaned up and added more tests (one of which fails because there

	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Corrected comment; removed ERRORALERT.

	* [r6439]

	  topographica instances...is the problem the gui quit?).

	* [r6397] doc/buildbot/master.cfg:

	  Removed part of task.

	* [r6354] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Removed outdated ERRORALERT.

	* [r6353] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:

	  meant). Also fixes history in projection window.

	* [r6352] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Changed an on_change to on_modify (which is what was really
	  meant). Also fixes history in projection activity.

	  in plotgrouppanel and plotgroup will be cleaned up.)

	  Don't apply changes to text variables immediately unless
	  requested.

	* [r6327] topo/tkgui/tkguiwindow.py:

	  (what we are currently using) becomes TaggedSlider. Added
	  TaggedSlider3, a far simpler class which appears to perform the
	  same, but isn't quite finished.

	* [r6321] topo/tkgui/tkguiwindow.py,
	  topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Moved TaggedSliders into tkguiwindow from translatorwidgets.

	  Added some documentation to SomeTimer.

	* [r6314] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:

	  from XPlotGroup; no ill effects apparent

	* [r6248] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Fixed Projection plots to rescale properly from the _orig_bitmap,
	  not the scaled one

	* [r6247] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Moved enlarge and reduce implementation to the plotgroup

	* [r6246] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:

	  Added question about reporting problems.

	* [r6236] doc/Developer_Manual/alerts_text.php:
	  Changed HACKALERT to ERRORALERT because 'error' has a clearer
	  meaning than 'hack'. (Existing HACKALERTs in the code have not
	  yet been replaced with ERRORALERTs.)

2007-08-24  jbednar

	* [r6235] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added docstring

	  doc/Developer_Manual/testing_text.php:
	  Added doctest documentation.

2007-08-22  jbednar

	* [r6216] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Clarified docstring, hopefully correctly

	* [r6215] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Removed obsolete alert

	  Made coordinate default be floating-point, just in case

	* [r6211] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Made more constants be floating-point to avoid problems with
	  integer
	  division, especially for measure_rfs().

	* [r6210] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Minor clarification to label

2007-08-22  jprovost

	  Added support for tests written as doctest files.

	* [r6206] topo/sheets/saccade.py:
	  Updated ShiftingGeneratorSheet to generate a new pattern every
	  time there is an eye movement. Added output port to send out the

	  Added test pattern window to basic-gui-tests.

2007-08-21  ceball

	* [r6199] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Packing separated from widget creation in pack_param. Added
	  pack_params() to ParametersFrame2 to do what
	  ParametersFrame.__new_widgets() does (i.e. set the parameters out
	  on a grid, ordered by precedence).

	* [r6198] topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Update to match changes in tkparameterizedobject.py.

	* [r6197] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Cleaned up _widgets/_furames ALERT.

	* [r6196] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed from widgets_in_history to params_in_history (simpler -
	  will be switching more things from referring to widgets to
	  referring to parameters). Updates to match changes in
	  tkparameterizedobject.

	* [r6195] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Added HACKALERT.

	* [r6194] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Switch to hide_param() from manual destruction of widgets.

	* [r6193] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Simplification to pack_param.

	* [r6192] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Correct version of 1.56-->1.57 checkin (i.e. this version is a
	  corrected 1.57).

	* [r6191] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Revert to version 1.56 (i.e. discard previous checkin) because of
	  bug that would stop everyone being able to open plots.

	* [r6190] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Simplify code to create button widgets.

	* [r6189] doc/Downloads/cvs_text.php:
	  Added note about checking buildbot.

	* [r6188] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Correct bug where help text was being displayed incorrectly for
	  buttons, and was being displayed at all for entry boxes.

	* [r6187] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Corrected typo in previous checkin.

	* [r6186] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  ParametersFrame2: added show/hide parameter widget methods;
	  confirm close if unapplied changes; unimportant changes to
	  buttons docs (only for testing).

2007-08-20  ceball

	* [r6185] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  ParametersFrame2: to match ParametersFrame, pack() itself and put
	  parameters into an inner frame.

	* [r6184] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Simplified AttributeError messages (don't print whole repr() of
	  objects - which led to pages of output - and cleaned up
	  internally).

	* [r6183] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  ParametersFrame2: Added some compatibility with model editor.

	* [r6182]
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Add a constant parameter among the test parameters.

	* [r6181]
	  doc/Developer_Manual/testing_text.php:
	  Added automatic testing section.

	* [r6180] doc/buildbot,
	  doc/buildbot/master.cfg:
	  Initial version for doozy, with only only slave (also on doozy).

2007-08-20  jbednar

	* [r6179] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Added command-line control over retinal density

	* [r6178]
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Minor spelling fix in messages

2007-08-20  ceball

	* [r6177] doc/User_Manual/commandline_text.php:
	  Updated GUI scripting section. (Plus removed unnecessary
	  semi-colons from examples.)

2007-08-20  jbednar

	* [r6176] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added catch for right-clicking for an RF when Receptive Fields
	  plot
	  hasn't been run yet.

2007-08-20  ceball

	* [r6175] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Started to have menu commands return their objects, so that the
	  GUI can be scripted more. For instance:
	  act_win=topo.guimain['Plots']['Activity']();act_win.normalize=False.
	  At some point soon, should be able to script enough in the
	  activity window to - for instance - simulate a right click for
	  opening a connection fields window, allowing us to add a test to
	  ensure that the right-click opening of connection fields windows
	  does not get broken.

2007-08-20  jbednar

	* [r6174] doc/User_Manual/commandline_text.php,
	  doc/User_Manual/index_text.php:
	  Added instructions for controlling the GUI from the command line

	* [r6173] doc/Links/index_text.php:
	  Mentioned NEST interface

	* [r6172] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Removed apparently unused random_generator code

2007-08-20  ceball

	* [r6171] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Corrected mistake: need to convert object to string when checking
	  if current value is in range.

2007-08-19  ceball

	* [r6170] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Don't try to set constant parameters, unless they're in a
	  ParameterizedObjectMetaclass instance.

	* [r6169] Makefile:
	  Update to syntax for invoking GUI menu items.

	* [r6168] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Update to accessing Connection Fields menu item.

	* [r6167] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Switch menus to tkguiwindow.ControllableMenu, and add
	  dictionary-style access to TopoConsole's menubar. Removed
	  plots_menu_entries, since the plot menu item 'EntryName' can now
	  be accessed by topo.guimain['Plots']['EntryName'].

	* [r6166] topo/tkgui/tkguiwindow.py:
	  Menu: take indexname to be label, if indexname not supplied.
	  Added comment about possibly removing indexname, though there is
	  probably some case where it would be necessary.

	* [r6165] topo/tkgui/tkguiwindow.py:
	  Menu class: renamed self.contents to self.indexname2index; made
	  actual item (if a menu or command) available to access. Added
	  ControllableMenu, which allows dictionary-style access to menu
	  items.

	* [r6164] topo/tkgui/tkguiwindow.py:
	  Addition to comment.

	* [r6163] topo/tkgui/tkguiwindow.py:
	  Corrected typo in previous checkin.

	* [r6162] topo/tkgui/tkguiwindow.py:
	  In Menu, override invoke() so that commands can be invoke()d by
	  name. (Plus cleanup: moved index conversion into a general method
	  so that it can be used by all methods.)

	* [r6161] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Switched order of two lines in __init__ (so we add the shadowed
	  PO before initializing Parameter values; previously it was in
	  this order, but got switched accidentally during a recent
	  cleanup). Not sure if anything we currently do would have been
	  affected by this.

2007-08-18  ceball

	* [r6160] Makefile:
	  Change syntax of command for basic GUI window opening.

	* [r6159] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Make PlotsMenuEntry call()able.

	* [r6158] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed system for passing around warnings.

	* [r6157] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Warnings not displayed in the GUI.

2007-08-15  jbednar

	* [r6156] external/Imaging.diff:
	  Added patch for 64-bit ECDF machine, to get rid of 'encoder zip
	  not available' messages from tests that use PIL

	* [r6155] external/Makefile:
	  Added patch for 64-bit ECDF machine, to get rid of 'encoder zip
	  not available' messages from tests that use
	  PILexternal/Imaging.diff

2007-08-14  jprovost

	* [r6154] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Patched up a problem with connections to EPs that are not sheets.
	  Temporary fix only -- eventually such EPs should appear in the
	  editor.

2007-08-13  ceball

	* [r6153] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed mistaken if-test.

	* [r6152] doc/Forums/index_text.php:
	  Added link to the Windows forum.

	* [r6151] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Started to add ability to change the shadowed
	  ParameterizedObject, and methods to match calls meant for
	  parametersframe.ParametersFrame. Intermediate checkin, and
	  shouldn't affect existing code.

2007-08-12  ceball

	* [r6150] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added to task.

	* [r6149] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updates to various tasks.

	* [r6148] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added to note.

	* [r6147] topo/tests/hierarchical.ty_DATA:
	  Data from 2007/04/25 03:53 GMT (i.e. after SOM changes).

	* [r6146] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  All Parameters except Boolean are represented in the GUI by
	  StringVar (because the Parameters themselves take care of things
	  like checking types, so we don't want any restrictions from the
	  GUI variable). Added translation between __repr__ and objects so
	  that widgets can accept any valid Python expression, and
	  repr()esentations are displayed in the GUI for objects. Various
	  cleanup. Not yet finished, although I think ParametersFrame2 now
	  has at least all the features of ParametersFrame.

	* [r6145] topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py:
	  Added TaggedSlider2: TaggedSlider, but without some of the
	  translation stuff. (Not finished.)

	* [r6144] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added trivial method to display a message on the status bar.

2007-08-11  ceball

	* [r6143] Makefile:
	  Added test to allow quick checking of GUI windows.

	* [r6142] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added 'check' option to quit method, so quit can be invoked
	  without requiring someone to confirm.

	* [r6141] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed Refresh button since Reset does the same.

	* [r6140] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Uncommented section mistakenly commented-out in previous checkin.

	* [r6139] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Intermediate checkin (should still be no change to existing GUI).
	  Can reverse precedence of TkParameterizedObject and its extraPO
	  for finding parameters. Continued to work on ParametersFrame2.
	  General cleanup.

	* [r6138] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Minor update to note.

2007-08-10  ceball

	* [r6137]
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  TkParameterizedObject now only supports one ParameterizedObject
	  (previously it was any number, but that was too confusing and
	  probably unnecessary).

2007-08-10  jbednar

	* [r6136] doc/Reference_Manual,
	  doc/Reference_Manual/.cvsignore:
	  More to ignore

	* [r6135]
	  doc/Developer_Manual/refactoring_text.php:
	  Added more info on refactoring

2007-08-10  ceball

	* [r6134] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Intermediate checkin: began trying to adapt TkparameteredObject
	  to handle objects of type ParameterizedObjectMetaclass as well as
	  those of type ParameterizedObject in extra_pos.

2007-08-10  jbednar

	* [r6133] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Minor tweak to get more info during training

2007-08-10  ceball

	* [r6132] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added title to ParametersFrame2. Added support to
	  TkParameterizedObject for displaying constant parameters.

	* [r6131] topo/tkgui/testpattern2.py:
	  Replaced RangedParameter.

2007-08-10  jbednar

	* [r6130] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Split more plotting commands

	* [r6129] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Split commands to have a separate plot_command when appropriate

2007-08-10  ceball

	* [r6128] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  ParametersFrame2: added right-click editing for OptionMenu.
	  TkParameterizedObject: added help text for current item in
	  OptionMenu.

2007-08-10  jbednar

	* [r6127] external/Makefile:
	  Moved psyco out of default make targets, as it is not available
	  on 64-bit platforms

	* [r6126] doc/User_Manual/plotting_text.php:
	  Small fix to documentation

	* [r6125] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Various updates

2007-08-10  ceball

	* [r6124] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Replaced RangedParameter with ObjectSelectorParameter. Extended
	  TkParameterizedObject to handle ClassSelectorParameter. Updated
	  ParametersFrame2. Intermediate checkin (with everything still
	  working).

	* [r6123] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Replaced temporary RangedParameter with ObjectSelectorParameter.

	* [r6122] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Added ObjectSelectorParameter, with SelectorParameter as a parent
	  in common with ClassSelectorParameter. Intermediate checkin.

2007-08-09  ceball

	* [r6121] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Popup help bound to label (if present), rather than the whole
	  enclosing frame as before. If there's no label, help is bound to
	  the enclosing frame.

	* [r6120] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added doc string.

	* [r6119] topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Recovered doc for strength-only parameter.

	* [r6118] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Added input_sheet to the displayed command to make it more
	  obvious to users.

	* [r6117] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Added command to size Projection windows (for bwidget version).

	* [r6116] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Expand panel frames in windows, so that contents expand when
	  window sizes are increased.

	* [r6115] topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py:
	  Added note for users.

	* [r6114] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Try to improve appearance when opening panels with bwidget built
	  by keeping the window hidden until its construction is complete.
	  Still a small window appears just shortly before it's expanded to
	  full size, but it seems to be better.

	* [r6113] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Removed update_command, plot_command, and redraw from Test
	  Pattern window. Left Refresh button, but it's not in a great
	  position. Removed Back and Fwd buttons.

	* [r6112] topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Removed FullFieldFeatureCurvePanel, because with the 'redraw'
	  button on PlotGroupPanel it is now redundant.

	* [r6111] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Undo previous checkin, which was mistaken.

	* [r6110] topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py:
	  Removed duplicate Redraw button.

	* [r6109] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Moved Refresh button next to update_command, and added Redraw
	  button next to plot_command.

	* [r6108] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Separated plot_command from (update_)command.

	* [r6107] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Minor addition to doc.

	* [r6106] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Corrected method to match Parameter class to widget-creation
	  method (previously, could not match subclasses of the
	  widget_creators dictionary key). Renamed __update_param to
	  _update_param so that subclasses can acces it. Added sketch of a
	  replacement ParametersFrame (using TkParameterizedObject), and
	  temporarily modified TkParameterizedObjectBase methods to work
	  with ClassSelectorParameter; RangedParameter needs to be turned
	  into something permanent.

2007-08-08  ceball

	* [r6105] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added a comment.

	* [r6104] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Minor renaming and changes to documentation. Should be no visible
	  change.

	* [r6103] topo/commands/analysis.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/plotting/templates.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Renamed plotcommand Parameter to plot_command.

	* [r6102] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:

	  how that works in ParametersFrame; should be no visible change.

	* [r6098] topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py:
	  Added option to refresh the TaggedSlider widget when setting the
	  bounds.

2007-08-08  stuart_p_wilson

	* [r6097] examples/lissom_whisker_barrels.ty:
	  First version that seems to work well

2007-08-08  ceball

	* [r6096] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed provision for packing hidden parameters (not necessary,
	  since pack_param is called manually). Clarified code for trying
	  to set widget bounds.

	* [r6095] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Moved some Parameter name formatting into a method, and added
	  capitalization. Renamed variables in, and cleaned up,
	  pack_param() (should be no visible change from this).

2007-08-01  jbednar

	* [r6094] doc/Downloads/cvs_text.php:
	  Removed apparently unused and unrecognized option to checkout

2007-07-31  ceball

	* [r6093] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Hack to make pattern generator change update the plot to the
	  right stage. (This TestPattern class will be replaced with one
	  from testpattern2.py.)

	* [r6092] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Fixed ConnectionFields window: now opens with correct
	  coordinates, if coordinates were specified.

	* [r6091] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Try to set widget's bounds, if Parameter has bounds.

2007-07-31  jbednar

	* [r6090] doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php,
	  doc/Tutorials/lissom_or_text.php,
	  doc/Tutorials/som_retinotopy_text.php:
	  Put -g at the end of command lines for safety

	* [r6089] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Changed -g to work wherever it is specified, instead of being
	  reordered, to allow command-line commands and scripts to control
	  an open GUI. Added indication that startup files are being
	  processed, since that recently caused confusion regarding psyco

	* [r6088] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Removed apparently unnecessary check for topo.gui_cmdline_flag

2007-07-31  ceball

	* [r6087] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Renamed a variable; should be no visible change.

2007-07-30  jbednar

	* [r6086] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Minor cleanup; should be no change.

2007-07-28  jbednar

	* [r6085] topo/misc/__init__.py:
	  Removed obsolete file

2007-07-27  jbednar

	* [r6084] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Moved GUI code after all command-line arguments have been
	  processed, to allow scripts to add items that will be used in the
	  GUI, and to avoid hiding missing imports in the scripts

	* [r6083] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added potentially useful toolboxes

2007-07-26  jbednar

	* [r6082] doc/User_Manual/commandline_text.php:
	  Added info about save_plotgroup

2007-07-24  jbednar

	  Requires DISPLAY.

2007-07-23  jbednar

	* [r6077] examples/lissom_whisker_barrels.ty:
	  Initial version, based on converting lissom_oo_dr.ty 1.2 to have
	  no on/off channels. Not yet tested at all.

	* [r6076] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Added Sweeper class for wiping patterns across a surface; not
	  well tested yet

	* [r6075] examples/lissom_oo_dr.ty:
	  Removed explicit delays and instead implemented exactly as in the
	  CMVC book

	* [r6074] examples/Makefile:
	  Added lissom_oo_dr targets

	* [r6073] examples/lissom_oo_dr.ty:

	  move

	* [r6072] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Minor addition

2007-07-22  jbednar

	  Added matrixplot facility for visualizing
	  membrane_potential_trace.

	* [r6068] topo/commands/pylabplots.py:
	  Added named option "aspect" to matrixplot() so that y/x aspect
	  ratio
	  can be adjusted for certain plots like time series. Higher aspect
	  ratio means taller y axis relative to the x axis.

2007-07-19  ceball

	* [r6067]
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed mistaken test. (I had forgotten that the default
	  representation of a Parameter (in the GUI) is by a string
	  variable.)

2007-07-19  yschoe

	* [r6066] examples/leaky_lissom_or.ty:
	  Added one more membrane potential trace to highlight withi-group
	  synchronization.

2007-07-18  yschoe

	* [r6065] examples/leaky_lissom_or.ty:
	  Learning rate and membrane potential trace locations changed a
	  bit.

	* [r6064] examples/leaky_lissom_or.ty:
	  First spiking LISSOM example that shows rudimentary sync/desync
	  behavior.
	  Much needs to be cleaned up though.

	* [r6063] topo/sheets/slissom.py:
	  Dynamic threshold and membrane potential calculation/plotting
	  facilities added.
	  Simply do, e.g.

	  topo.sim["V1"].plot_trace()

	  in the example script.
	  This the a first rudimentary version that showd
	  synchronization/desynchronization behavior.

	* [r6062] topo/commands/pylabplots.py:
	  Added "style" option in vectorplot() so that data points can be
	  plotted as
	  points rather than interpolated lines.

2007-07-15  ceball

	* [r6061] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Instantiate RangedParameter (RangedParameter is temporary, I
	  hope). Added sheet_type to XPlotGroup.

	* [r6060]
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added test to show a bug (currently failing).

	* [r6059] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Mofidications to comments and docs. No visible changes.

2007-07-14  ceball

	* [r6058] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added note.

2007-07-13  ceball

	  Updated some documentation.

	* [r6051]
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added to range-handling test.

	* [r6050]
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Test when a parameter has a range.

	* [r6049]
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Tests direct get/set of Parameters.

	  Minor addition to text.

	* [r6045]
	  topo/tests/testtkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Initial version.

	* [r6044] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Classes have empty name attribute, so just because 'name'
	  attribute exists doesn't mean it will be valid.

	* [r6043] topo/tkgui/testpattern2.py:
	  Commented out unused method. Added some debugging print
	  statements. Corrected some mistakes.

2007-07-12  ceball

	* [r6042] topo/tkgui/testpattern2.py:
	  Pattern generator is now a parameter (and deals with list of
	  objects rather than classes so that changes are kept - might
	  revert that).

	* [r6041] topo/tkgui/testpattern2.py:
	  Continued simplifying. 'Apply to' buttons temporarily not
	  functional.

	* [r6040] topo/tkgui/testpattern2.py:
	  Corrected some mistakes.

	* [r6039] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Moved another task to the bug tracker.

	  Added note about SF trackers. Moved two tasks to SF trackers.

	* [r6032] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Call grid plot in measure_rfs*() rather than in
	  ReverseCorrelation. measure_rfs_noise() updated to accept
	  input_sheet.

	* [r6031] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py,
	  topo/commands/pylabplots.py:
	  Moved grid plotting from ReverseCorrelation.

2007-07-11  ceball

	* [r6030] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Minor modification to comment.

	* [r6029] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  measure_rfs() requires an input_sheet argument (at least for the
	  moment).

	* [r6028] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  RF plot option displays plot for specific sheet.

	* [r6027] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  RFs are calculated for all sheets for which measure_maps=True.

	* [r6026] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Pass input sheet to ReverseCorrelation.

	* [r6025] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Correction to FeatureResponses.__init__ to accept params. Added
	  input_sheet parameter to ReverseCorrelation. ReverseCorrelation's
	  grid is now an array of arrays rather than a list of lists.

	* [r6024] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Cut out more duplicated code.

	* [r6023] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Removed apparently outdated JABHACKALERT.

	  Added some markers, reorganized, removed ALERTs, removed a
	  workaround (left note).

	* [r6020] topo/tkgui/testpattern2.py:
	  Version 1.71 of testpattern.py. Going to re-work the test pattern
	  window in this file (since the test pattern window is complex).

	* [r6019] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Minor simplifications, plus removed a HACKALERT that was in the
	  wrong place.

	* [r6018] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Minor simplifications, plus added a HACKALERT.

	* [r6017] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  All ProjectionSheetPGPanels call refresh on sheet_change.
	  Corrected bug in ConnectionFieldsPanel's sheet_change method (if
	  x and y not specified, were not being reset to 0).

	* [r6016] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Renamed some variables for easier understanding - no visible
	  change.

	* [r6015] topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py:
	  Uncommented a test, which now works.

	* [r6014] topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py:
	  Plot file saving only works for topo.sim (not some other
	  Simulation with register=False); removed ALERTs related to this.

	* [r6013] topo/tests/testsnapshots.py:
	  Use a new topo.sim for the tests.

	* [r6012] topo/tests/testsnapshots.py:
	  Altered confusing 'Sheet.nominal_density' line, because if
	  GeneratorSheet's nominal_density is set in another test, setting
	  Sheet's nominal_density makes no difference. Added some
	  commented-out code. Added a HACKALERT.

	* [r6011] topo/tests/testsnapshots.py:
	  Corrected bug introduced in previous checkin: was loading
	  different snapshot from that saved.

2007-06-26  ceball

	* [r6010] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added comment for cleanup.

	  Changed location of testsnapshot.typ.

	* [r6003] topo/tests/testsnapshots.py:
	  Added comment and changed save location to be in tests directory.

	* [r6002] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Removed now-unnecessary hack (since timer object's __getstate__
	  no longer removes contents of the timer's lists).

	* [r6001] topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Moved don't-pickle-receive*-lists hack from timer to
	  topo.commands.basic.save_snapshot().

2007-06-25  jprovost

	* [r6000] topo/tests/testsnapshots.py:
	  Added test to make sure that saving/loading snapshots doesn't
	  break the ability to construct a new simulaiton.

	  Sorted the list of tests, so the execute in the same order on all
	  machines.

	  Fixed a test interaction affecting testcf.py

2007-06-24  ceball

	* [r5997] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Intermediate checkin. Made ReverseCorrelation be a subclass of
	  FeatureResponses to cut down on code duplication. Might need to
	  think about the proper class hierarchy.

	* [r5996] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  display=False by default for measure_rfs().

	* [r5995] topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py:
	  Added ALERT. Added better filename prefix.

	  topo/tests/.cvsignore:
	  More to ignore.

	* [r5991] topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py:
	  Named the simulation so test's saved files always have the same
	  name.

	* [r5990] topo/commands/pylabplots.py:
	  Minor modification to comment.

	  Modified ALERT.

	* [r5986] topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py:

	  Added a comment.

	* [r5984] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Can control which dictionary plot and update commands get
	  executed in (might not want it to be __main__.__dict__ if the
	  commands are imported somewhere other than __main__.__dict__).

	* [r5983] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Removed stray print statement.

	* [r5982] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Support previous syntax of save_group command (i.e. requesting
	  sheets and projections by name).

	* [r5981] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Corrected oversight during update of plotgroup classes
	  (preventing projection plotgroup saving).

	* [r5980] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added more comments to task.

	  featureresponses.

	* [r5969] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added update() call in timing_message() in case it's used without
	  timing_progress().

	  topo/tests/testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Commented out test that isn't testing anything but did start

	  before using it to replace various bits of timing code around
	  topographica.

	* [r5935] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Some more refactoring of GUI classes (still not finished).
	  Removed Parameters from FeatureCurvePlotGroup that are now
	  unnecessary.

	* [r5934] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed a stray print statement.

	* [r5933] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added to comment.

	* [r5932] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Removed stray print statements.

	* [r5931] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Updates for changes to PlotGroupPanel classes.

	* [r5930] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Multiple changes, but 2 significant ones: (1) Brought in changes
	  from tkgui_parameterization_branch; (2) RangedParameters get
	  translation between name and object for display in GUI. Whole
	  file now needs a review.

	* [r5929] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Patchwork of updates to keep current TestPattern class working
	  with new plotgroups. (At least it opens without crashing and
	  seems to work as well as before.)

	* [r5928] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Brought in changes from tkgui_parameterization_branch, with
	  additional changes to generate_plotgroup mechanism and
	  sheet+projection changing.

	  topo/tkgui/projectionactivitypanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Brought in changes from tkgui_parameterization_branch, with
	  additional changes to generate_plotgroup mechanism.

	* [r5926] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Brought in changes from tkgui_parameterization_branch. Began to
	  simplify updating vs drawing plots.

	* [r5925] topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py:
	  Brought in changes from tkgui_parameterization_branch. Trying
	  'redraw' button on full-field version.

	* [r5924] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Brought in changes from tkgui_parameterization_branch. Further
	  improved separation of drawing and updating plots.

	* [r5923] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Rather than having parameters on the *Saver objects shadowing
	  those on the underlying PlotGroups, just pass parameters to the
	  PlotGroups. Added Connection Fields saver.

	* [r5922] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Set parameters directly on PlotGroup rather than on
	  PlotFileSaver.

	* [r5921] topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py:
	  Added set_bounds() method to taggedslider.

	* [r5920] topo/base/boundingregion.py,

	  Added SequenceGeneratorSheet for generating timed sequences of
	  inputs.

	* [r5912] topo/base/projection.py:

	  when getting a single named projection.

	* [r5911] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Updated some error messages to better show the attribute name.

	* [r5910] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:

	  Added HACKALERT.

2007-06-14  jbednar

	* [r5907] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Fixed bug since version 1.85: the projection's output_fn was
	  effectively being ignored because it was called not on the
	  Projection activity but on a stray throwaway object. I don't know
	  of any case where the Projection output_fn was being used, so it
	  hasn't been noticed

	* [r5906] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Removed mistaken alert

2007-06-13  jprovost

	* [r5905] topo/base/cf.py:

	  Added some comments.

	* [r5902] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  __setup_params() renamed to _setup_params() so it can be
	  overridden in subclasses. Added hack to allow some kind of a
	  system for passing warnings around (...to the gui).

2007-06-11  ceball

	  Added notes to mac task.

	* [r5890] topo/tests/som_retinotopy.ty_DATA:
	  Data from 2007/05/05 06:00 GMT CVS version of topographica.
	  Updated because density of example was changed.

	* [r5887] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Removed unnecessary reference to topo.sim

	* [r5886] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  - Removed redundant type checking on EPConnection src and dest.
	  - Allowed Simulation.grid_layout to take references to simulation
	  objects, not just names.

	* [r5885] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  - Small change to instance method wrapping in CallableParameter
	  - Added DictParameter.

	  Added item for Mac GUI cleanup.

2007-06-06  chrispalmer

	* [r5882] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  defaults at a high scale to allow mapping of rfs for
	  lissom_oo_or.ty, this model currently recieves very week input to
	  V1 and should probably be modified

2007-06-06  ceball

	* [r5881] topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Hack to get normalize from the template.

2007-06-05  ceball

	* [r5880] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Updated to use plotgroup_label, not plotgroup_key. Updated
	  open_test_pattern_window()

	* [r5879] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Hacked to work with changes to PlotGroupPanel: needs major
	  overhaul. These changes don't need to copied to
	  tkgui_parameterization_branch (that's where the major overhaul
	  will occur.

2007-06-04  jbednar

	* [r5878] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:

	  Minor improvement to docstring

	* [r5875] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Turned off display by default

	* [r5874] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Cleaned up cruft left in previous checkin. Localized temporary
	  code for ReverseCorrelation into a small area so that it can be
	  moved later

	* [r5873] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Cleaned up cruft left in previous checkin

	* [r5872] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Trivial change to title string

	* [r5871] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Removed space and ampersand characters from filenames

	* [r5870] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Added exception for common error condition

	* [r5869] topo/commands/analysis.py,
	  topo/commands/basic.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Moved save_plotgroup command from basic.py to analysis.py because
	  it only works if other things from analysis.py are loaded

	* [r5868] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Added filename_format parameter and cleaned up

	* [r5867] topo/commands/basic.py,

	  Removed bogus spaces

2007-06-04  ceball

	* [r5865] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Corrected bug in bwidget version: after changing PlotGroupPanel
	  back to being a Frame, forgot to set certain attributes on its
	  master (the window) rather than on itself.

2007-06-04  jbednar

	* [r5864] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Fixed defaults mistakenly changed.

	* [r5863] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:

	* [r5856] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added comment.

2007-06-02  ceball

	* [r5855] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Added assertion statements to catch misnamed projections/sheets.
	  (The errors raised by the PlotGroups are too cryptic to realize
	  what's going wrong if you specify a projection that doesn't exist
	  for a sheet.)

2007-05-31  jbednar

	* [r5854] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Removed bogus print statement

	* [r5853] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Added save_plotgroup command as a simple interface. Changed file
	  format from PNG to png.

2007-05-31  ceball

	* [r5852] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Various changes that were not present in previous checkins but
	  should have been (i.e. were listed in the log messages). Started
	  ImageCompositor class.

	* [r5851] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Added a comment.

	* [r5850] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Continued writing. The projection saver now probably works for
	  projection plots where the images are different sizes.

2007-05-30  ceball

	* [r5849] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Added some notes.

	* [r5848] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Added beginning of CFProjectionPlotGroupSaver. Removed old,
	  commented-out code. This version isn't suitable for anyone to
	  use.

	* [r5847] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Added temporary filename prefix parameter.

	* [r5846] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Changes to comments.

	* [r5845] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Commented out existing code. Added quick first implementation to
	  allow saving of templateplotgroups (e.g. activity, orientation
	  preference).

	* [r5844] topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  (Re. new class.) Update command appears in the correct location.

	* [r5843] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  (Re. new classes.) Updated with changes to right-click menu.

	* [r5842] topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added saving of any canvas (to postscript).

	* [r5841] topo/tkgui/tkguiwindow.py:
	  Change to comments and imports: no visible changes.

	* [r5840] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Use indexing-by-name Menu class.

	* [r5839] topo/tkgui/tkguiwindow.py:
	  Made a subclass of Tkinter.Menu that allows indexing by some
	  (fixed) name, rather than just by current position.

	* [r5838] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  (Re. new, unused class.) Continued matching behavior of current
	  panel.

2007-05-29  ceball

	* [r5837] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  (Re. new, unused classes.) Minor changes: some rearranging and

2007-05-27  ceball

	* [r5836] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed '_widgets2' and made _widgets a dictionary.

2007-05-26  ceball

	* [r5835] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  (Re. new, unused classes.) Changes to match alterations to
	  tkparameterizedobject (which has become a ParameterizedObject).

	* [r5834] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Renamed TkPO to TkParameterizedObjectBase, and WidgetDrawingTkPO
	  to TkParameterizedObject. TkParameterizedObjectBase is back to
	  being a ParamterizedObject that creates Tkinter.Variable shadows
	  of its Parameters, but now it also shadows Parameters of any
	  optional additional ParameterizedObjects it is given.

2007-05-24  ceball

	* [r5833] topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  (re. new, unused class) Minor change to match plotgrouppanel
	  becoming a ParameterizedObject.

	* [r5832] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  (re. new, unused classes) Made PlotGroupPanel2 be a
	  ParameterizedObject and have parameters. Stores another
	  WidgetDrawingTkPO to edit those parameters (can't stay like
	  that).

	* [r5831] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added (trial) ButtonParameter. WidgetDrawingTkPO is not a Frame
	  anymore (since it could be drawing its widgets on anything, so
	  there is no benefit that it's a Frame).

2007-05-23  ceball

	* [r5830] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  (Re. new, unused classes.) Added some notes. Removed special code
	  for integer scaling (there's an alert in plotgroup now about
	  that).

	* [r5829] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added strength-only parameter to TemplatePlotGroup, but it
	  currently does nothing. Added hackalerts about that and
	  PlotGroup's integerscaling parameter.

	* [r5828] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  (Re. new, unused classes.) Reduce/enlarge buttons work in
	  history. Removed alert that is covered by one in plotgroup
	  itself.

	* [r5827] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  (Re. new, unused classes.) Updated (and simplified a little) the
	  history code to work with new panel.

	* [r5826] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added possibly temporary list for accessing widgets of
	  WidgetDrawingTkPO.

	* [r5825] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added comment.

	* [r5824] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Made new panels look more like the old ones. Added some comments
	  to help my reading (temporary).

	* [r5823] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  (Re. new, unused classes.) Began to clean up some naming. Also
	  additional minor changes.

	* [r5822] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Added mechanism to allow a callback when a tk variable is set
	  (e.g. to allow a panel to have a function called when the
	  parameter is changed). Also, widget can optionally be drawn
	  inside a supplied frame (untested).

	* [r5821] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Continued working on new versions of PlotGroupPanel and
	  TemplatePlotGroupPanel; should be no change to code of existing
	  panels. (New versions are currently a mess.)

2007-05-22  jbednar

	* [r5820] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Fixed bug introduced in revision 1.12 on 15 March 2007; as part
	  of timing code added to show progress on measuring maps, input
	  patterns were being presented twice instead of only once. This
	  did not affect the normal process of measuring maps, but for some
	  networks that keep track of activation counts or have some other
	  unusual architectures, there may have been some effect on the
	  results of map or curve measurement

2007-05-20  ceball

	* [r5819] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Working on making PlotGroupPanel and TemplatePlotGroupPanel
	  WidgetDrawingTkPOs. The existing classes are not changed (i.e. no
	  visible changes).

	* [r5818] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Labels are added by WidgetDrawingTkPO. Commented out demo code.

	* [r5817] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Use get_param and set_param methods to access TKPO's
	  parameterized_object's parameters (if that's even going to be
	  necessary...).

2007-05-19  ceball

	* [r5816] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  t=TkPO() provides access to its parameterized_object's parameter
	  p via t.p__param, rather than as t.p (since t could also be
	  another type of object with its own attributes). This is just for
	  testing: might revert. Also, Tkinter Variables (shadows of
	  Parameters) are now guaranteed never to return out-of-date
	  values. Adding a refresh method that gets called e.g. on focus in
	  for a WidgetDrawingTkPO would keep the GUI pretty well in sync
	  with the underlying ParameterizedObject.

	* [r5815] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py:
	  Added comment.

	* [r5814] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  WidgetDrawingTkPO is a Frame, too. Added plotgroup template
	  example.

	* [r5813] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  No longer pass through unused **params.

	* [r5812] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Commented out demo code, and added a docstring.

	* [r5811] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Change to comment.

	* [r5810] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Updates to documentation, some renaming, and some cleaning.

	* [r5809] topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py,
	  topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py:
	  Renamed TaggedSlider's 'tagvariable' to 'variable'.

2007-05-18  jbednar

	* [r5808]
	  doc/Developer_Manual/optimization_text.php:
	  Added notes about optimizing Python

2007-05-18  ceball

	* [r5807] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed some irrelevant docstrings. Corrected comment.

	* [r5806] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  No visible change: altered variable name and added comment.

	* [r5805] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  First pass at using a subobject to proxy Parameters.

2007-05-18  rczhao

	* [r5804] external,
	  external/.cvsignore,
	  external/Makefile:
	  Added pytables, which required adding pyrex and hdf5. hdf5
	  doesn't compile yet, but it's possible to get things working with
	  an external hdf5 library for now

2007-05-18  ceball

	* [r5803] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Minor change to have correct widget chosen automatically.

2007-05-18  jbednar

	* [r5802] topo/commands/analysis.py,
	  topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Changed location of imports; moved FaceSpace2Dfromfile into
	  face-space/face_space_patterns.py and Caricaturization Preference
	  maps into face-space/analysis.py

	* [r5801] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added to-do item

2007-05-18  ceball

	* [r5800] topo/tkgui/tkparameterizedobject.py:
	  Initial version; currently just to test out mechanisms for
	  Tkinter Variable/Topographica Parameter coupling (tkpo.py as sent
	  by e-mail to JAB 2006/05/17, slightly modified for Topographica).

2007-05-18  jbednar

	* [r5799] examples/face_space.ty,
	  facedb,
	  topo/patterns/face.py:
	  Moved examples/face_space.ty to face-space/face_space.ty,
	  facedb/aam_fit_data.h5 to face-space/aam_fit_data.h5, and
	  topo/patterns/face.py to face-space/face_space_patterns.ty

2007-05-18  ceball

	  Added a HACKALERT.

	* [r5777] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Moved restore_panel_environment() up to SomethingPanel (even
	  thought the classes are going to change, this reduces
	  duplication.

	* [r5776] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Don't set the situate status (temporary; avoids the
	  request-projection-views-from-non-cfsheets bug described in a

	* [r5771] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionactivitypanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Renamed self.situate to self.situate_var. Restored previous
	  default situate and auto-refresh states to various panels
	  (differences between them had been lost).

	* [r5770] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  valid_context() checks for CFProjections, not just Projections
	  (since the classes expect CFs).

	* [r5769] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionactivitypanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  One valid_context() method for ConnectionFieldsPanel,
	  ProjectionPanel, ProjectionActivityPanel. (I assume that the
	  valid_context() methods were out of date for
	  ConnectionFieldsPanel and ProjectionActivityPanel; if that
	  assumption is wrong, then the differences should be restored.)

2007-05-12  ceball

	* [r5768] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Added alert. Removed outdated docstring.

	* [r5767] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Auto-refresh and auto-resize variables are traced, allowing the

	* [r5762] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Commented out seemingly unused import.

	* [r5761] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:

	  Cleaned up imports.

	* [r5759]

	  ProjectionActivityPanel into a shared parent class.

	* [r5758] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Intermediate checkin: started to move common code from
	  ConnectionFieldsPanel and ProjectionPanel into a shared parent
	  class.

	* [r5757] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Mover super() call to the start of __init__.

	* [r5756] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Removed individual alerts about things only being valid for CFs:
	  they are covered by the general JABALERT. Minor simplification to

	* [r5755] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  More renaming: should be no visible change.

	* [r5754] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Removed projection_refresh() method since it doesn't do anything.

	  change.

2007-05-11  ceball

	* [r5746] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Replaced HACKALERT with ALERT: ProjectionPanel now at least
	  checks that the Projections are CFProjections.

	* [r5745] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Minor simplifications to _create_projection_dict() (should be no
	  visible change).

	  topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionactivitypanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Where we just want a list of the Projections into a
	  ProjectionSheet, use the sheet's list of in_connections (i.e.
	  replace projections().values() with in_connections).

	* [r5742] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Removed redundant assertion (connections are guaranteed to be
	  Projections at connection time).

	* [r5741] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Minor change to comment.

	* [r5740] topo/base/projection.py:

2007-05-06  ceball

	* [r5728] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Initial scrolled frame size is now small (it can grow if
	  required).

	* [r5727] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Replaced Pmw's scrollable frame with one from bwidget. If bwidget
	  is built, scrollbars are used - if not, then the behavior is as
	  before. The scrolling and resizing still isn't perfect, and it's
	  a bit complex. Restored auto-resize check button code.

	* [r5726] topo/tkgui/__init__.py:
	  Added a note.

	* [r5725] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:

	* [r5719] topo/commands/pylabplots.py:
	  Added gradient plot (from JB's octave code).

	* [r5718] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Took the command prompt off TopoConsole, which allowed a lot of
	  simplification of the code. (Unfortunately now TopoConsole looks
	  a little spartan.) The command prompt is now a class, and a
	  command prompt window can be opened from the simulation menu.

	* [r5717] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Removed messagebar's outer frame, and replaced learning_group's
	  with a Tkinter frame.

	* [r5716] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:

	  Corrected a previous oversight.

	* [r5708] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Renamed and tidied up things related to the test pattern window.
	  Renamed __plot_menu() to __plots_menu().

	* [r5707] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Removed unused variable. Removed reset_network() (which didn't do
	  anything).

	* [r5706] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Cleaned up the run_script method.

	* [r5705] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Corrected typos in simulation_menu. Renamed load_script to
	  run_script, and began to tidy that up.

	* [r5704] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Use Tkinter.Menu instead of Pmw.MainMenuBar. There should be no
	  visible change to the TopoConsole GUI.

	* [r5703] topo/tkgui/__init__.py:
	  Added some notes.

	  changed tuning curves, orientation tuning curves now plotted
	  differently, some template tuning curve parameters no longer
	  required

2007-04-11  antolikjan

	* [r5364] examples/joublin_bc96.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or_homeoscale.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or_noshrinking_latswitch.ty:
	  modified code to use the new iterators

	* [r5363] topo/learningfns/projfns.py,
	  topo/responsefns/projfns.py:
	  modified code to use the new iterators

	* [r5362] topo/learningfns/som.py:
	  modified code to use the new iterators

	* [r5361] topo/sheets/optimized.py:
	  A new class implementing a C optimized version of the
	  NeighbourhoodMask class was added

	* [r5360] topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Changed the code to use the new iterators. Also the C code was
	  modified to use directly the new mask that is accessed through
	  the iterator to optimize code.

	* [r5359] topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Changed the code to use the new iterators

	* [r5358] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  The SharedWeightProjection was now changed to use the new
	  iterators

	* [r5357] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Two iterators were added to the code. Both of these iterate
	  through connection fields of given projection. The base iterator
	  iterates through all projections fields whereas the dervied Mask
	  iterator iterates only over connection fields corresponding to
	  the unmasked positions. All code in cf.py was changed to use
	  these iterators instead of directly accessing _cfs

	* [r5356] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  The code was modified to use the new mask optimization.
	  Particularly the initialization and the reset of the mask was
	  added to the timing logic of the LISSOM class

	* [r5355] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Two new classes were added SheetMask and derived NeighborhoodMask
	  that define the masking for the new optimization. The
	  ProjectionSheet mask now owns a new parameter that points to one
	  of these masks (the SheetMask by default)

2007-04-11  ceball

	* [r5354] topo/tkgui/__init__.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added alert.

	* [r5353] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Made autosize mask be a hidden parameter so it doesn't show up in
	  the GUI.

	* [r5352] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added comment.

	* [r5351] Makefile:
	  Reduced precision of tests, so that results from one processor
	  (checked into CVS) can still be tested on another.

	* [r5350] /trunk/topographica-win/common/python_topo.tar.gz:
	  Upgraded to numpy 1.0.2.

	* [r5347] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Also make menubar cascades activate when the cursor is over them.

	* [r5346] topo/tkgui/__init__.py:
	  Moved code for making cascades open automatically to topoconsole.
	  Removed commented-out code. Console is already resizable -
	  doesn't need to be specified.

	* [r5345] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Main menu is Pmw.MainMenuBar, so is now a proper Toplevel menu
	  (should display as a native menu bar i.e. along the top for OS
	  X). Minor re-organization of methods. Context-sensitive help for
	  menus temporarily disabled. Asks for confirmatio?\004n before
	  quitting. Clicking 'x' on the window is like quitting from the
	  menu (rather than just closing the topoconsole window). Moved in
	  code for making cascades open automatically (from __init__.py).

	* [r5344] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Update weave. Removed startup commands task (at least it works,
	  although it might need improving).

2007-04-09  jbednar

	* [r5343] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Enabled icon, to see if it is ok on other platforms

	  menu commands?

2007-04-05  ceball

	* [r5337] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added test that the console has not already been destroyed before

	* [r5333] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Moved alert.

	* [r5332]
	  /trunk/topographica-win/create_python_topo/numpy-1.0.1.win32-py2.4.exe,

	  /trunk/topographica-win/create_python_topo/setup.bat:
	  Upgraded to numpy 1.0.2.

	* [r5331] topo/tests/test_script.py:
	  Added alert & commented out speed assertion statement.

	* [r5330] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Added popup help to buttons on parameters frame. The buttons are
	  still likely to be confusing, though.

	* [r5329] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added task.

	* [r5328] Makefile:
	  Added comment.

	* [r5327] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Minor change to comment.

	* [r5326] topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Added 'execute_next' parameter, which is a list of commands that
	  will be executed when the simulation is next run(), and which are
	  guaranteed only to run once. Might need to be reviewed (but fixes
	  repeated-normalization bug).

	* [r5325] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updates to various of my tasks.

	  Added documentation notes

2007-04-05  ceball

	* [r5323] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Commented out scrollbars, so behavior of all plotgrouppanels
	  should revert.

	* [r5322] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Moved examples/Makefile task to complete before release.

	* [r5321] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added some tasks to complete for the release.

2007-04-04  ceball

	* [r5320] examples/setup.py:
	  Continued working on quickly translating the Makefile. Probably
	  finished, but needs simplifying.

	* [r5319] external/numpy-1.0.1.tar.gz:
	  Upgraded to 1.0.2.

	* [r5318] topo/tests/test_script.py:
	  Added assertion that speed hasn't increased by more than 5%.

	* [r5317] external,
	  external/.cvsignore,
	  external/Makefile:
	  Upgraded to numpy 1.0.2 (which, for us, primarily fixes the
	  subtract-reduce bug. All slow-tests pass, and make compare_oo_or
	  passes too. Some speeds appear to have improved:
	  lissom_or_homeoscale increased by 8%, and lissom_oo_od by 4.5%.
	  Other scripts did not change in speed by more than 1%. (Some of
	  the speed tests are still a little short to be completely
	  reliable.)

	* [r5316] external/numpy-1.0.2.tar.gz:
	  From numpy.scipy.org

	* [r5315] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  'Duration to present for' and 'Apply to pattern in' boxes no
	  longer expand.

	* [r5314] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Renamed a variable.

	* [r5313] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Use ParameterizedObject from topo.base.parameterizedobject.

	* [r5312] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Added alert.

	* [r5311] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionactivitypanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  BasicPlotGroupPanel inherits from Toplevel instead of Frame
	  because it's a window, not a Frame.

	* [r5310] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added comment.

	* [r5309] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added task to do before upcoming release.

	* [r5308] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added HACKALERT.

	* [r5307] topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added alert.

	* [r5306] topo/tests/testplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tests/testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/__init__.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  TopoConsole is the main application window, so it inherits from
	  Tkinter.Tk: this eliminates an extra frame.

	* [r5305] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Removed some unused imports.

	* [r5304] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Enabled scrollbars for plots. Scrolling needs to be
	  re-implemented after tkgui is cleaned up.

	* [r5303] topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Fixed some widget expansions.

2007-04-03  jbednar

	  Removed unused imports

2007-04-03  judelaw

	* [r5301] examples/lissom_oo_or_noshrinking.ty:
	  Changed afferent scheduled learning rate to be exponential decay,
	  updated homeostatic parameters

2007-04-02  jbednar

	* [r5300] topo/sheets/optimized.py:
	  Cleaned up formatting, comments

	* [r5299] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Minor clarifications, plus help for the stop button

	* [r5298] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Fixed representations of list parameters

2007-04-02  ceball

	* [r5297] topo/tkgui/editortools.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Can reset new object frame to state when last opened.

	* [r5296] topo/tkgui/editortools.py:
	  Enabled Apply button for new objects: allows changing the class
	  defaults.

	* [r5295] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Added comment.

	* [r5294] topo/tkgui/editortools.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Updated button names.

	* [r5293] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Have Apply, Reset, Close buttons, plus a Defaults one.

	* [r5292] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Removed timing task.

	* [r5291] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Removed script_repr task. Scheduled actions task for a later
	  release. Minor change to introductory text.

	* [r5290] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Removed currently unnecessary GUIToplevel class.

	* [r5289] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Removed apparently unused frame.

2007-04-01  ceball

	* [r5288] topo/__init__.py:
	  Slightly improved script_repr's collection of import statements.
	  Should be no change to behavior.

	* [r5287] topo/base/boundingregion.py,
	  topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Slightly improved script_repr's collection of import statements.
	  Should be no change to behavior.

	* [r5286] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Should have been present in previous checkin: generate import
	  statements for connections.

	* [r5285] topo/__init__.py:
	  Quick way to have script_repr() produce import statements. Needs
	  to be re-implemented more cleanly.

	* [r5284] topo/base/boundingregion.py,
	  topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Quick way to have script_repr() produce import statements. Needs
	  to be re-implemented more cleanly.

	* [r5283] topo/misc/inlinec.py:
	  Minor change to warning text.

2007-03-30  ceball

	* [r5282] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated priorities of my tasks.

	* [r5281] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Changed formatting so it's easier to write tasks that will be
	  formatted ok on the html version. Added introduction. Tidied a
	  couple of tasks.

2007-03-29  jbednar

	* [r5280] doc/Future_Work/index_text.php:
	  Minor updates

2007-03-29  ceball

	* [r5279] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Reduced priority of lissom_oo_or_reference matching cleanup.
	  Merged some duplicate tasks. Added a new task.

2007-03-29  jprovost

	* [r5278] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Made EditorObjects inherit from ParameterizedObject and added
	  some parameters, so that the default view type (activity/normal)
	  can be set in a script or in the .topographicarc.

2007-03-29  ceball

	* [r5277] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Added some documentation for the autosizemask parameter.

2007-03-29  jprovost

	* [r5276] topo/tkgui/__init__.py:
	  Improved contextual menu support for Mac OS X.

	* [r5275] topo/coordmapperfns/basic.py:
	  Factored Ottes SC mapping.

	* [r5274] topo/commands/pylabplots.py:

2007-03-29  ceball

	* [r5273]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty,
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.param:
	  First go at matching scheduled actions, and running to 20000.

	* [r5272]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Updated to go to 200 iterations.

	* [r5271]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Added a note.

	* [r5270] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Added back temporary parameter 'autosizemask' to CFProjection to
	  allow matching with c++.

	* [r5269] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added back task to document general advice for optimization.

	* [r5268]
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000000.wts.Primary.Afferent01.023_023.matrix:
	  Added by mistake instead of gzipped version.

	* [r5267]
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000000.wts.Primary.Afferent01.023_023.matrix,
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000000.wts.Primary.Afferent01.023_023.matrix.gz:
	  From c++ lissom.

	* [r5266]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Added note.

	* [r5265]
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000001p000.Eye0_Activity.matrix.gz,
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000001p000.Ganglia00_Activity.matrix.gz,
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000001p000.Ganglia01_Activity.matrix.gz,
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000001p000.Primary_Activity.matrix.gz,
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000001p000.Primary_InputResponse.matrix.gz,
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000050p000.Eye0_Activity.matrix.gz,
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000050p000.Ganglia00_Activity.matrix.gz,
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000050p000.Ganglia01_Activity.matrix.gz,
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000050p000.Primary_Activity.matrix.gz:
	  Removed potentially out of date and currently unused results.

	* [r5264] topo/tests/reference,
	  topo/tests/reference/.cvsignore:
	  Updated with current matrix files to ignore.

	* [r5263] topo/tests/reference,
	  topo/tests/reference/.cvsignore:
	  Ignore ref. sim. log file.

	* [r5262] topo/coordmapperfns,
	  topo/coordmapperfns/.cvsignore:
	  Initial version.

	* [r5261] /trunk/topographica-win/create_python_topo/jpeg-6b-3.exe:
	  Apparently no need to have jpeg package (PIL binary seems to have
	  it).

	* [r5260] /trunk/topographica-win/create_python_topo/setup.bat:
	  Apparently no need to add jpeg package (PIL binary seems to have
	  it).

	* [r5259] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Jpeg support already exists in PIL (or in Windows, possibly - at
	  least I don't think it's possible for us to control where the
	  jpeg library is found when using the pre-built binary).

	* [r5258] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Had already added gnosis utils.

	* [r5257] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated topographica-win task. Demoted scrollbar task. Promoted
	  Makefile->python script task.

	* [r5256] topo/tests/test_script.py:
	  Minor modification to printing.

	* [r5255] Makefile:
	  Added comment.

2007-03-28  jbednar

	* [r5254] doc/Downloads/cvs_text.php:
	  Added note about x11SDK on Mac

2007-03-28  ceball_cvs2svn

	* [r5253] /tags/cnv_course_2007_2,
	  /tags/cnv_course_2007_2/topographica-win:
	  This commit was manufactured by cvs2svn to create tag
	  'cnv_course_2007_2'.

2007-03-28  rczhao

	* [r5252] topo/coordmapperfns/basic.py:
	  Fixed tailing "^ M" characters.

2007-03-28  ceball

	* [r5251]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Ganglia masks no longer set directly from r_L. Ganglia weights
	  back to not matching.

	* [r5250] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Reverted to version 1.79 (the only difference being modification
	  of one comment).

	* [r5249]
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000000.wts.Primary.Afferent01.000_000.matrix.gz:
	  Temporary addition to cf.py: a parameter that allows the size of
	  the mask to be overridden. Eye-Ganglia initial weights match to 6
	  d.p. for c++ lissom and topographica (Primary afferents still
	  match to 8 d.p., as before; 6 d.p. is probably the best value
	  possible with Gaussian patterns, and is the same as for Gaussian
	  patterns on the Eye). The Eye-Ganglia matching happens because
	  Ganglia patterns are drawn with radius r_L (as in c++ lissom),
	  rather than with the radius of the actual connection field.
	  Additionally, there are some other minor changes that might be
	  reverted.

	* [r5248] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty,
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000000.wts.Ganglia00.Afferent0.000_000.matrix.gz:
	  Temporary addition to cf.py: a parameter that allows the size of
	  the mask to be overridden. Eye-Ganglia initial weights match to 6
	  d.p. for c++ lissom and topographica (Primary afferents still
	  match to 8 d.p., as before; 6 d.p. is probably the best value
	  possible with Gaussian patterns, and is the same as for Gaussian

	  Additionally, there are some other minor changes that might be
	  reverted.

	* [r5247]
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000000.wts.Ganglia00.Afferent0.012_012.matrix.gz,
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000000.wts.Ganglia01.Afferent0.000_000.matrix.gz,
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000000.wts.Ganglia01.Afferent0.012_012.matrix.gz:
	  Initial version.

	* [r5246] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Made status bar look like topoconsole's. (Should it also have a
	  labeled frame round it?)

2007-03-28  jbednar

	* [r5245] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Made first section be the actual tasks left for the 0.9.3 release

	* [r5244] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Added startup commands to the list

2007-03-28  rczhao

	  Added ConstantMapper class

2007-03-28  jbednar

	* [r5242] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Added note about repeated weight normalizations

2007-03-28  ceball

	* [r5241] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Pressing return in the 'duration' box causes the pattern to be
	  presented.

	* [r5240] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added to comments.

	* [r5239] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed dynamic info to be displayed in a Pmw MessageBar. The
	  message bar expands to fill the window's width, so we see as much
	  of a message as possible in the current window. The message bar
	  does not expand automatically for long messages, so the window
	  size does not change rapidly when the message length changes
	  rapidly.

2007-03-28  jprovost

	* [r5238] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Removed some spurious code.

	  Removed mask workaround for LGNOnToFSA and LGNOffToFSA such that
	  all connection fields' masks are now circular.

2007-03-27  jbednar

	* [r5235] topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added abs to fft plots to make sure they are real valued. Flipped
	  axis to make the background white to match the CMVC book's plots

	* [r5234] doc/Future_Work/index_text.php,
	  doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php,
	  doc/Tutorials/lissom_or_text.php,
	  topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Added window updating and refreshing for map measurement commands

	* [r5233] doc/Future_Work/index_text.php:
	  Minor update

	* [r5232] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Made windows be updated during training. Added Stop button to
	  interrupt training.

2007-03-26  ceball

	  Added task about abstract classes. Added info to
	  Makefile->setup.py task.

2007-03-26  jbednar

	* [r5230] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Restored note about right-click menu expansibility

	* [r5229] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Made lists of ParameterizedObjects format like a list of
	  ParameterizedObject.script_repr() instead of an unreadable
	  mishmash. Made script_repr_suppress_defaults into a module
	  attribute so that it wouldn't show up on script_repr output

	* [r5228] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Added script_repr representations of schedule_command events and
	  topo.sim.name. Added section headings.

	* [r5227] examples/lissom_oo_or_noshrinking.ty:
	  Added another fix from Jude

	* [r5226] examples/lissom_oo_or_noshrinking.ty:
	  Added changes from Jude

2007-03-26  ceball

	* [r5225] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated matching task. Removed combobox/ballon-help task. Removed
	  slow-tests/Makefile task. Updated build-on-windows task. Added
	  Makefile->setup.py task. Minor change to tkgui-cleanup task.
	  Added scrollbars-on-plotgrouppanel-windows task. Updated
	  right-click-menu task. Added task about notes for efficient array
	  computations.

2007-03-26  jbednar

	* [r5224] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added note about MDP

	* [r5223] examples/lissom_oo_or_noshrinking.ty:

	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or_homeomaxent.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or_homeomaxent.ty,
	  examples/lissom_photo_or.ty:
	  Changed abbreviations to strings instead of startup commands, as
	  they didn't actually work for snapshots

	* [r5214] Makefile:
	  Added snapshot-tests target

	* [r5213] examples/lissom_fsa.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,

	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or_homeomaxent.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or_homeomaxent.ty,
	  examples/lissom_photo_or.ty:
	  Moved convenience variables into startup commands so that
	  snapshots will work during training

	* [r5211] examples/lissom_fsa.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or_homeomaxent.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or_homeomaxent.ty,
	  examples/lissom_photo_or.ty:
	  Removed local copies of n_units() in favor of the one now in
	  CFProjection, to avoid pickling warnings

	* [r5210] examples/lissom_oo_or_homeomaxent.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or_homeomaxent.ty,
	  examples/lissom_photo_or.ty:
	  Added missing imports

	* [r5209] topo/learningfns/optimized.py,

	  topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Removed unused imports

	* [r5204] topo/base/cf.py:

	  Distinguish between right-click event (which needs to persist for
	  submenu commands) and other events (which are no longer stored,
	  since they should be used immediately or discarded). Events that
	  do not occur on a plot of a sheet (or that occur on a plot of a

	  those that do by the presence of 'plot' rather than 'coords'.

	  Anything using __process_canvas_event_info() now gets the correct
	  information about a sheet at the edge of a plot (so e.g. the
	  dynamic info does not indicate the mouse is on a sheet unit when
	  in fact it is on the plot's border).

	  Dynamic info. text is only present when mouse is inside a plot.

	  Uncommented connection fields-launching menu code, so connection
	  fields can be opened from the right-click menu.

	  PlotsMenuEntry's command() takes optional arguments, which are
	  passed onto the class (plot window, or whatever) that is created.

	  The c code optimized version of compute_joint_normalize in the

	* [r5102] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Change the handling of mask for the apply_learn_output_fn and
	  compute_joint_norm_totals, now this mask is set to the activity
	  of neurons thus preventing of uneccessary recomputation of
	  weights of inactive neurons

	  load_snapshot() works automatically with xml or normal pickle
	  snapshots.

	* [r4977] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  load_snapshot opens uncompressed or gzipped files.

	* [r4976] /trunk/topographica-win/common/python_topo.tar.gz:
	  Updated to include packages to match standard topographica (all
	  external default packages are present, but jpeg-6b is untested).

	  Added notes about testing xml pickling.

	* [r4969] topo/commands/basic.py:

	  pickling at present. Removed HACKALERT about pickling
	  topo.sim.actual_sim.

	* [r4968] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Snapshots use gzip, compresslevel=5.

2007-03-01  ceball

	* [r4967] examples/setup.py:

	  Moved PickleSupport class from topo.__init__ to
	  PicklableClassAttributes class in topo.base.parameterizedobject.
	  Instance of PicklableClassAttributes is created just before
	  pickling. This is an intermediate checkin.

	* [r4960] examples/lissom_fsa.ty:
	  The connection weights of RetinaTOLGNOn and RetinaTOLGNOff are

	  has been fixed.

	  like a shell.

	  SharedWeightCFProjection has been reimplemented by Jan Antolik to
	  have
	  a cfs data structure (now renamed _cfs to discourage direct
	  usage)
	  that is nearly entirely compatible with the one from
	  CFProjection.
	  The shared _cfs now contains a CF for every neuron, where the
	  weights
	  are all views (slices) of a single shared CF that stores the
	  actual
	  weights. Apart from the sharing, it works just like in
	  CFProjection.

	  This allowed us to remove the special DummyCF and
	  CFPRF_SharedWeightDotProduct_opt classes entirely, replacing them
	  with
	  the standard ConnectionField and CFPRF_DotProduct_opt (modified
	  to
	  allow non-contiguous arrays).

	  External code should now avoid using _cfs. To get the shape of
	  the
	  projection without accessing _cfs, a new property
	  CFProjection.cfs_shape has been added. The projections have also
	  been
	  simplified to store the bounds_template internally, rather than
	  sending it around as a parameter.

	  The result should be much simpler to maintain, test, and
	  understand,
	  but at least on lissom_oo_or.ty the results are unchanged.

	* [r4869] examples/lissom_oo_od.ty:
	  Updated to use numpy instead of Numeric, on a separate CVS branch
	  named numpy_test_branch. First, ran the automatic conversion
	  code:

	  import numpy.oldnumeric.alter_code1 as noa
	  noa.converttree('topo') noa.convertall('examples') # (After
	  temporarily renaming .ty to .py)

	  The main automatic changes were:

	  - Changed 'import Numeric' to 'import numpy.oldnumeric as
	  Numeric'
	  - Changed 'from Numeric import' to 'from numpy.oldnumeric import'
	  - Converted .flat to .ravel()
	  - Changed typecode= to dtype=
	  - Eliminated savespace() and spacesaver()

	  Then cleaned up the results by hand:

	  - Removed all traces of savespace
	  - Replaced custom ExtraPickler and ExtraUnpickler with
	  standard pickle.Pickler and pickle.Unpickler
	  - Used 'from numpy import inf' instead of the previous ad-hoc way
	  of
	  generating an infinite float. Cleaned up and simplified handling
	  of
	  division-by-zero and underflow errors for Gaussian-based
	  patterns.
	  - Updated weave version to work with numpy. Also adds full SciPy
	  distribution, although it is not yet unpacked and built
	  automatically
	  - Upgraded matplotlib to work with numpy.
	  - Patched numpy to fix bug in numpy.subtract.reduce.
	  - Removed the Wrapper class entirely, now that numpy's ufuncs
	  deepcopy without problems.
	  - Changed numpy array printing to show the actual data for any
	  array up
	  to 200*200 by default.
	  - Removed -Wl from LD_FLAGS for compiling Python, to make it
	  compile
	  on OS X 10.4.8 (intel and ppc) even though that platform does not
	  have or need the -rpath option

	  to specific values for testing; similarly, only some scheduled
	  events are present. These files can be made more general later
	  on. At this revision, the two simulations' weight values
	  consistently match to at least 4 d.p. over 550 iterations (I
	  haven't yet tested to more than 4 d.p. or 550 iterations). Both
	  files need to be tidied up.

	  Made the new object parameters appear in the model editor, rather
	  than as a separate window. Needs some tidying up now.

	* [r4671] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  The root of the editor window is not created by calling Tk(), but
	  is created by calling Toplevel(). Tk() - which initializes Tk -
	  'should only be called once per application'. This change
	  corrects some strange behavior (for example: having a
	  ParametersFrame inside a model editor window previously resulted
	  in a non-functional ParametersFrame).

2007-01-25  r_primrose

	* [r4670]
	  examples/sullivan_neurocomputing04.ty:
	  added orientation code for sweeping lines

2007-01-25  jbednar

	* [r4669] examples/lissom_oo_od.ty,
	  topo/base/arrayutils.py:
	  Removed previous bogus checkin

	* [r4668] examples/lissom_oo_od.ty,
	  topo/base/arrayutils.py,
	  topo/base/cf.py:
	  Fixed boolean comparison against array, to be compatible with
	  both Numeric and Numpy

	* [r4667] topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  Added assertion to catch confusing problem

	* [r4666] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Fixed longstanding bug -- if there were multiple input sheets
	  with different sizes (as in hierarchical.ty), patterns were being
	  presented by PatternPresenter with the same size in each sheet,
	  causing undefined behavior for values off the edge of the
	  ConnectionFields for each neuron.

2007-01-24  jbednar

	* [r4665] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Changed default argument for pattern_present to present an empty
	  set of patterns, rather than give an error

	* [r4664] topo/misc/inlinec.py:
	  Fixed previous checkin -- was turning off optimization by default

	* [r4663] topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/misc/inlinec.py,
	  topo/outputfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Moved component substitution code into
	  provide_unoptimized_equivalent function for simplicity and to all
	  the messages to be disabled when necessary

	* [r4662] examples/goodhill_network90.ty:
	  Simplified and changed from a CFPLearningFn to a Sheet; no real
	  change
	  in capabilities (other than commenting out some code that was not
	  working).

	* [r4661] examples/goodhill_network90.ty:
	  Minor cleanup of docstrings and comments

2007-01-24  fdemertzis

	* [r4660] examples/goodhill_network90.ty:
	  Implemented further the learning function

2007-01-24  jbednar

	* [r4659] external,
	  external/.cvsignore,
	  external/Makefile,

	  Added numpy to allow transition from Numeric

	* [r4658] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Minor cleanup

	* [r4657] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py:
	  Simplified docstring

	* [r4656] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py:
	  Simplified docstring

2007-01-23  jbednar

	* [r4655] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Removed duplicate code in enlarge() and reduce()

	* [r4654] topo/plotting/templates.py,
	  topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed PlotGroupTemplate.initial_plot to plot_immediately, to
	  avoid confusion with the entirely unrelated
	  PlotGroup.initial_plot. Made the default *not* to plot
	  immediately, because most user-added plots will need to be
	  measured somehow first, which is usually slow

	* [r4653] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed right click to print plot name as well as the region name

	* [r4652] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed to use plot's new rescale() method, and removed the
	  temporary hacks previously required for keeping track of the
	  scaling factors (using plot's new scale_factor instead).

	* [r4651] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Added method to rescale the images, keeping the original image
	  around for later rescaling, and storing the current scale_factor

2007-01-23  judelaw

	* [r4650] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  in pattern_present if any output_fn has a learning parameter then
	  set this to false during presentation of patterns

	* [r4649] topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py:
	  added learning parameter which can turn homeostatic learning off
	  during measurement of maps or curves

2007-01-23  jbednar

	* [r4648] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Trivial reformatting of docstrings

2007-01-22  judelaw

	* [r4647] topo/plotting/templates.py,
	  topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  corrected Contrast Response Full field - should be replotted each
	  time unit is changed to avoid using wrong orientation

	* [r4646] topo/commands/analysis.py,
	  topo/commands/pylabplots.py,
	  topo/plotting/templates.py,
	  topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py:
	  corrected error in prerequisite name, added sheet name to
	  warnings in feature curve measurement

	* [r4645] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  corrected error in parameters for measure_or_tuning_fullfield

	* [r4644] topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py:
	  added warnings for prerequisites

	* [r4643] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  added a prerequisites paramleter for curves

	* [r4642] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  added a get_curve_time to FeatureCurvePlotGroup to get timestamps
	  from Curve SheetViews

	* [r4641] topo/commands/pylabplots.py:
	  changed tuning_curve_data to support getting data from SheetViews
	  rather than arrays

	* [r4640] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  separated warnings for prerequisites in measure curves commands
	  so that defaults can be used separately

	* [r4639] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  changed curve_dict to contain SheetViews rather than activity
	  arrays in FeatureCurves

2007-01-22  ceball

	* [r4638] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  The row and col calculated for the matrix of a plot that is right
	  clicked on are integer row and column indexes.

	* [r4637] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added right click popup menu to PlotgroupPanel, showing the row
	  and column of the matrix corresponding to where was clicked on a
	  plot. Lots of the code is to illustrate how this could be used,
	  but does not currently do much.

	* [r4636] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added hack to store the original scaling factor. Might not be
	  required if that information is already available.

2007-01-21  jbednar

	* [r4635] topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Trivial cleanup

2007-01-21  ceball

	* [r4634] topo/tkgui/editortools.py:
	  Upgraded hack for 'new object properties' window: now clicking on
	  close does not destroy the window, but only hides it. This
	  prevents the error messages that used to appear if the window was
	  closed but then the user wanted to add another new object.

	* [r4633] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added comment about clicking the window's 'X' to quit.

	* [r4632] topo/tkgui/editortools.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Removed Reset button from the ParametersFrame for new objects,
	  because reset is not yet implemented for a class in a
	  ParametersFrame. Added reminder in parametersframe.

	* [r4631] topo/tkgui/editortools.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Changed how to request which buttons a ParametersFrame should
	  display.

2007-01-20  judelaw

	* [r4630] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  call command and plot command separately

	* [r4629] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  made command and plot command separate in full field curve
	  templates

	* [r4628] examples/laminar.ty:
	  corrected name, now laminar_or.ty

	* [r4627] examples/laminar_or.ty:
	  version with better self organisation

	* [r4626] examples/laminar_oo_or.ty:
	  *** empty log message ***

2007-01-20  jbednar

	* [r4625] examples/Makefile:
	  Added measure_cog and measure_position_pref

2007-01-19  jbednar

	* [r4624] topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py:
	  Put commands side by side

	* [r4623] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Changed order of feature measurement so that the display option
	  is more meaningful

	* [r4622] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added help text for what to do when there is no plot on screen
	  yet

	* [r4621] doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php:
	  Updated to reflect the orientation map being saved with the file.

	* [r4620] examples/Makefile:
	  Added or maps and tuning curves to each snapshot

	* [r4619] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Turned display option off by default to allow usage in batch mode

	* [r4618] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Set up to be a better starting point for using the timestamps
	  saved with curve data

2007-01-19  ceball

	* [r4617] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Added a HACKALERT.

	* [r4616] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Added Cancel button.

	* [r4615] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  ParametersFrame for PatternGenerator has only Reset button.

	* [r4614] topo/tkgui/editortools.py:
	  New object properties window has only Reset button. Also added
	  some notes to myself for coming changes.

	* [r4613] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py:
	  ParametersFrame itself has Apply, Reset, and Ok buttons.

	* [r4612] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  ParametersFrame itself has Apply, Reset, and Ok buttons (which
	  can be displayed or not). Removed buttons from right-click
	  editing method.

2007-01-19  jbednar

	* [r4611] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Fixed curve_dict to be of type Float32 instead of Object to allow
	  it to be pickled

	  Added proj_name parameter to the measure_cog template so that
	  users can tell what to change when they don't get a plot

	* [r4609] examples/cfsom_or.ty:
	  Changed projection name to make measure_cog() work with no edits

	* [r4608] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/base/sheetview.py,
	  topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Fixed Projection plots to use timestamps. Removed inappropriate
	  import of topo into cf.py

	* [r4607] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed to use Plot's timestamps (created from the SheetView
	  timestamps) rather than the current time, to make it obvious when
	  old data is being plotted. Made various parts of the code work
	  when there were no plots (or only non-resizeable plots), to make
	  it possible to use any plots whose data *is* available while not
	  dying when there is no data available

	* [r4606] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Removed code duplicated between PlotGroupPanel.refresh() and
	  BasicPlotGroupPanel.refresh()

	* [r4605] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py,
	  topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/base/sheetview.py,
	  topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Added timestamp to SheetViews

	* [r4604] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Added timestamp to Plots. Added warning for when the bitmaps used
	  in the plots become too stale, i.e. are too far out of sync in
	  their timestamps

2007-01-18  jbednar

	* [r4603] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Changed print statements into warnings

	* [r4602] topo/misc/numbergenerators.py:

	  added a FullFieldFeatureCurvePanel for special case where full
	  field stimulus is used

	  changes to allow for plotting curves for LGN, ie. using default
	  values for orientation

	* [r4595] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  added sheets_to_measure code to allow for plotting curves for LGN

	  The little window for editing sheets/connections no longer
	  appears when the model editor is first opened.

	* [r4583] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Added reset method.

	* [r4582] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Added reset_params() method, to return parameters to class
	  default values.

	* [r4581] doc/User_Manual/parameters_text.php:
	  Added a missing space.

	* [r4580] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Changes made while right-click editing a Parameter are saved for
	  all values of the Parameter, not just its initial value. (Also
	  corrected an accidental deletion of a 'self.__' I committed
	  previously.)

	* [r4579] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Clarified some of the code relating to right-click editing of
	  ParameterizedObjects. There should be no visible changes.

2007-01-15  judelaw

	  added refresh_activity_windows function

	* [r4570] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  made changes to tuning curve plotgroup templates, added

2007-01-05  jbednar

	* [r4551] topo/analysis/featureresponses.py:
	  Cleaned up documentation, variable names, and private routines;
	  should not have changed behavior (except if callers used keyword
	  rather than positional arguments)

	* [r4550] topo/tests/testfeaturemap.py:
	  Fixed to work with featureresponses.py; was only working on
	  systems with a .pyc file hanging around from earlier versions

	* [r4549] ChangeLog.txt:
	  Updated with recent changes

2007-01-04  jbednar

	* [r4548] doc/User_Manual/patterns_text.php:
	  Made link more explicit

	* [r4547] doc/Makefile,
	  external/Makefile,
	  external/epydoc.diff:
	  Major fix to reference manual to provide documentation for
	  Parameters in classes. Patched epydoc to show parsed Parameter
	  values in all cases, so that introspection can be used to get the
	  __doc__ values for Parameters

	* [r4546] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/base/sheetcoords.py,

	  topo/tests/testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Cleaned up docstrings to make epydoc happy. All of the remaining
	  problems (42 markup errors as of today) should be due to included
	  modules, mainly in TkInter and in the python pickle support.

	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py,
	  topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py:
	  Changed **config to **params for a few ParameterizedObjects that
	  did not match the rest, for consistency. Should not have changed
	  any user-visible behavior in any way.

	  comments on Trace learning function. Changed to use
	  activity_type; shouldn't have any actual changes to behavior

	* [r4512]
	  examples/sullivan_neurocomputing04.ty:
	  Brought closer to what the paper seems to say, though there is
	  still a lot of work to do figuring it out

2006-11-30  r_primrose

	* [r4511]

	  Replaced special-purpose winner_coords function with general
	  array_argmax function

	* [r4493] examples/lissom_or_homeoscale.ty:
	  Added hack to initialize the average activities to those computed
	  during the initial period, rather than relying on that being done
	  within the HomeoSynaptic class. Changed outputfn from
	  PiecewiseLinear_debug to PiecewiseLinear_debug2 so that x_avg
	  would be available.

2006-11-24  ceball

	  Corrected citation

	* [r4488] Makefile,
	  examples/sullivan_neurocomputing06.ty,
	  examples/sullivan_nn06.ty:

	  it's actually based on the longer journal paper version

	* [r4487]
	  examples/sullivan_neurocomputing06.ty:

	  Added more to delete; not entirely sure of Windows syntax

	* [r4465] topo/misc/utils.py:
	  Clarified comments

2006-11-23  ceball

	* [r4464] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Having made topo.misc.utils.atof() actually return only floats,
	  it no longer worked as a translator for non-float (Integer in
	  this case) quantities, so switched it for a different one.

2006-11-23  jbednar

	* [r4463] Makefile:
	  Removed -g from compare target to avoid popping up the GUI at the
	  end

	* [r4462] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Fixed trivial typo

2006-11-23  ceball

	* [r4461] topo/misc/utils.py:
	  Minor change to comments.

	* [r4460] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Cleaned some comments.

	* [r4459] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated ParametersFrame task; I cleaned it up as far as my
	  current knowledge of topo.tkgui goes...beyond the changes I made,
	  I'm no better able to clean it up than another developer.

	* [r4458] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Changed the location of the hack to avoid TaggedSlider being used
	  to represent Numeric types other than floats.

	* [r4457] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Clean-up: re-ordered two methods, made some methods be private.

	* [r4456] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Removed a hackalert. Made a method private.

	* [r4455] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated tasks.

	* [r4454] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Added more information to a comment.

	* [r4453] topo/misc/utils.py:
	  Changed eval_atof() so that it produces a float from the string
	  it's given, unless that string is the name of a variable in
	  __main__, in which case it produces a float from the contents of
	  that variable. (I think that's what the original aim of the
	  method was.) If in_string, or the contents of the variable it
	  represents, does not contain something which can legitimately be
	  converted to a float, then string.atof() raises an error as it
	  would usually - before, illegitimate input resulted in a value of
	  0 or a non-float.

	* [r4452] topo/misc/utils.py,
	  topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py:
	  Moved an ALERT from topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py to
	  topo/misc/utils.py.

	* [r4451] topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py:
	  The 'optional_action()' method was not optional, but it is now.
	  (Fixes a bug where pressing return on e.g. test pattern window
	  leads to an error.)

	* [r4450]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Now advances the simulation time very slightly before comparing
	  weights, so that joint normalization has occurred before the
	  tests.

	* [r4449]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Changed calling syntax.

	* [r4448] Makefile:
	  Changed calling syntax of lissom_oo_or.ty.

2006-11-22  jbednar

	* [r4447] topo/tests/reference/Makefile:
	  Fixed typo in zcat definition; should run make clean to re-run
	  reference tests

	* [r4446] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Clarified window title task

2006-11-22  ceball

	* [r4445]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Changed calling syntax from plots=True/False to plots=1/0 to make
	  it easy to specify from Makefile (might not have been necessary).

	* [r4444] Makefile:
	  make COMPARISON_PLOTS=1 compare shows plots for results that
	  don't match.

	* [r4443]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_log_parser.py:
	  compare_elements() returns True or False depending on result of
	  comparisons.

	* [r4442]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Continued simplification.

	* [r4441]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Simplified setting up a test.

	* [r4440] Makefile:
	  Disabled plotting for 'comparisons'.

	* [r4439]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Prints pass/fail information for tests. Plotting optional. Some
	  previous tests commented out (there for future use).

2006-11-21  jbednar

	* [r4438] Makefile:
	  Added more files to strip from public release

	* [r4437] /trunk/topographica-win/common/setup.py,
	  /trunk/topographica-win/create_installer/topographica.iss:
	  Updated Windows version number

	  doc/Future_Work/index_text.php:
	  Added previously-commented-out sections of index_text.php to
	  current_text.php, plus other misc updates

	  Removed completed tasks

2006-11-21  chrispalmer

	  changed parameters to previously calculated values that match C++
	  version, added random Gaussian initial weights

	* [r4422] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Added sigmoid function and GeneralizedLogistic output functions

2006-11-20  jbednar

	* [r4421] examples/ohzawa_science90.ty:
	  Updated to match changes to rds.py. Added contents of Tikesh's
	  topo/analysis/testfeaturemap.py and topo/commands/test.py

	* [r4420] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Allowed Integers to be set to DynamicNumbers

	* [r4419] topo/misc/numbergenerators.py:
	  Added UniformRandomInt class

	* [r4418] topo/analysis/featuremap.py,
	  topo/commands/analysis.py,
	  topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Changed name of disparity maps to phasedisparity, because
	  XDisparity and YDisparity are also likely to be needed

	* [r4417] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  More documentation and comments for PatternPresenter

	* [r4416] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:

	  done

	* [r4415] topo/patterns/rds.py:
	  Added alert

	* [r4414] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Added missing import command. Added alert for disparity and
	  ocularity changes. Added warnings for unsupported configurations
	  for those maps.

	* [r4413] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Fixed trivial typo

2006-11-20  judelaw

	* [r4412]

	  Updated a method name to match changes in parametersframe.py.

	* [r4405] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Continued simplifying (by removing separate but near-identical
	  methods).

2006-11-19  ceball

	* [r4404] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Removed a task. Any developer with a windows machine can recreate
	  the python_topo directory, so packages can be updated (e.g.
	  python 2.4.2 to python 2.4.4 to catch up with the main
	  repository).

	* [r4403] /trunk/topographica-win/create_python_topo/README.txt:
	  Updated now weave is present.

	* [r4402]
	  /trunk/topographica-win/create_python_topo/scipy_test.tar.gz,
	  /trunk/topographica-win/create_python_topo/weave.tar.gz:
	  Weave, I think from scipy 0.3.2, compiled with mingw. Seems to
	  have been running on several different computers fine for a while
	  now. When topographica switches to a newer scipy, we'll be able
	  to use the binary version of scipy (as we do for Numeric, etc).
	  We can't do that now because scipy has been reorganized, and
	  weave is in a different place (for example).

	* [r4401] /trunk/topographica-win/create_python_topo/setup.bat:
	  Adds weave and a c compiler.

	* [r4400] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editortools.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Updated method names after changes to parametersframe.py.

	* [r4399] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Now there is only one method to have the ParametersFrame set
	  Parameters on its associated ParameterizedObject.

	* [r4398] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py:
	  Update method name to match change to parametersframe.py.

	* [r4397] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Update method name to match change to parametersframe.py.

	* [r4396] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Changed method name, tidied some documentation.

	* [r4395] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Updated variable name to match ParametersFrame's.

	* [r4394] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Just one variable for the associated object (whether it's
	  ParameterizedObject object or metaclass, rather than two. Only
	  one or the other variable was used in the past, not both
	  together.

	* [r4393] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Changed variable name topo_class to PO_class since we have
	  ParameterizedObject now, not TopoObject. This variable name still
	  isn't good, but I hope this file can be reorganized further
	  anyway.

	* [r4392] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Changed variable name topo_obj to PO_object.

	* [r4391] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Changed variable name topo_obj to PO_object since we have
	  ParameterizedObject now, not TopoObject. This variable name still
	  isn't good, but I hope this file can be reorganized further
	  anyway.

	* [r4390] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  No visible change, just a minor reorganization of a method

	* [r4389] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Added a note.

	* [r4388] /trunk/topographica-win/README.txt:
	  Removed some accidentally left-over text.

	* [r4387] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Minor update to a task.

	* [r4386]
	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000050p000.Ganglia01_Activity.matrix.gz:
	  Data from c++ lissom.

	  topo/tests/reference/oo_or_map_topo.000050p000.Primary_Activity.matrix.gz:
	  Data from c++ lissom.

	* [r4384]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Updated the number of excitatory units after changing the radius.
	  Made the automatic comparisons optional (by commandline
	  parameter). Added more automatic tests.

	* [r4383]
	  topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Removed a comment.

	  existed as a .pyc file on my computer for a long time...

2006-11-16  judelaw

	* [r4370] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:

	* [r4366] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/commands/analysis.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:

	* [r4365] topo/base/cf.py:
	  added new CFResponse_fn - Activity_dependent - for use with
	  lissom_or_noshrinking_latswitch.ty

	* [r4364]
	  examples/lissom_or_noshrinking_latswitch.ty:
	  version of lissom_or_noshrinking with long range lateral

	  need to change name

	* [r4362] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  removed conditions on loop in update_projectionactivity which was
	  causing update of sheet_view_dict to be skipped, not sure why
	  they were necessary, hopefully this hasn't broken anything else

2006-11-15  judelaw

	* [r4360] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  changed activation count to include loop for when settling is
	  turned off when measuring maps

	* [r4359] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  added a parameter which must be set to determine wether or not
	  settling is turned on when measuring maps (important for lissom
	  sheets)

2006-11-14  r_primrose

	  Updated name of method to match change to TaggedSlider's
	  refresh() and action() methods.

	* [r4355] topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py:
	  Pressing return in a TaggedSlider can cause more actions than
	  when it simply loses focus.

2006-11-14  jbednar

	* [r4354] topo/patterns/rds.py:
	  Removed special-purpose code for examples/ohzawa_science90.ty,

	* [r4348] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Fixed bug -- Integer parameters like rds.random_seed were
	  assigned TaggedSliders, but the TaggedSliders assume that the
	  result is floating-point, and so dragging the slider did not work
	  for such parameters

	* [r4347] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Made default orientation indicate that it is floating point

	  Renamed odf_science90.ty to ohzawa_science90.ty

	* [r4319] examples,
	  examples/.cvsignore:
	  I decided that the .typ files should be ignored, even though they
	  might be something the user wants to keep, because they keep
	  clogging up the cvs diff output and obscuring more important
	  changes

	* [r4318] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Clarified documentation, as suggested by Chris Ball

	  initial version

2006-08-15  judelaw

	* [r4117] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Made changes to centre of gravity plotting

2006-08-14  jbednar

	* [r4116] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Changed output_activity argument name to mask to clarify what the
	  data will be used for. Made all CFPOFs respect the mask, for
	  consistency.

	* [r4115] topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py:
	  Enabled some tests of composite patterns

	* [r4114] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Cleaned up comments and documentation

	* [r4113] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Re-enabled optimization that should now be safe again

	* [r4112] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/base/projection.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Changed name of apply_output_fn() to apply_learn_output_fn() to
	  clarify that it is different from the activity output_fn. (It's
	  called learn_output_fn instead of weights_output_fn because the
	  interface is specified at the ProjectionSheet level, and there is
	  no concept of weights at that level, only learning.) Made
	  apply_learn_output_fn() accept an explicit mask so that it can be
	  forced to apply to all units, and made all ones be passed in for
	  the intial iteration for joint normalization.

	* [r4111] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added typedef for activity matrices, to encourage consistency.

	* [r4110] examples/lissom_oo_od.ty:
	  Changed input pattern definition to be a class so that it can be
	  pickled. Temporarily changed learning rates to match
	  lissom_oo_or.ty.

2006-08-12  jbednar

	* [r4109] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Changed ON and OFF channels to have a single DoG projection,
	  instead of separate Center/Surround. Switched to joint
	  normalization. Changed default size of Gaussian for Test Pattern
	  window. Still needs parameter matching with the book simulations.

2006-08-11  jbednar

	* [r4108] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Deleted an optimization that was causing problems for joint
	  normalization

	* [r4107] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Changed __norm_total to _norm_total because hasattr() fails for
	  names starting with a __ (due to name mangling)

	* [r4106] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Trivial improvement to comment

	* [r4105] topo/misc/utils.py:
	  Added handing for case where an array shape is an empty list; not
	  sure why this would ever occur, but unpickling was failing until
	  this was added

	* [r4104] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Removed division by length of joint normalization group

	* [r4103] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Added joint normalization for the first iteration

	* [r4102] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Added default learning method for all ProjectionSheets, to
	  replace the one no longer in CFSheet

	* [r4101] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Moved methods related to joint normalization out of CFSheet and
	  into JointNormalizingCFSheet (in lissom.py), so that only models
	  using it will have to deal with that complexity.

	* [r4100] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Minor clarification

	* [r4099] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Replaced __normalize_joint_projections with
	  __compute_joint_norm_totals, which only updates the norm_total
	  property values, without actually doing any normalization

	* [r4098] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Renamed ConnectionField.sum to ConnectionField.norm_total to
	  emphasize that it is not necessarily always the sum.

	* [r4097] examples/joublin_bc96.ty:
	  Fixed missing import

	* [r4096] examples/joublin_bc96.ty:
	  Removed duplicate specification of weight_type, to ensure that it
	  is consistent with cf.py

	* [r4095] examples/joublin_bc96.ty:
	  Removed duplicate specification of weight_type, to ensure that it
	  is consistent with cf.py

	  Initial version.

	* [r4092] topo/tests/reference,

	  Script to help matching between c++ lissom and topographica.

2006-08-04  jbednar

	* [r4090] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Finished up the code for CFPOF_DivisiveNormalizeL1; mistakenly
	  checked in earlier

	* [r4089] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Removed outdated comment

	* [r4088] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Added patch to get old pickled files to work

	* [r4087] topo/base/cf.py,
	  topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/outputfns/basic.py,
	  topo/outputfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/tests/testoutputfnsoptimized.py:
	  Renamed _sum to __sum to make it private, and made all external
	  code use sum instead. This should prevent various problems found
	  when _sum did not exist, due to mixing optimized and
	  non-optimized components. Removed use of cached values in
	  DivisiveNormalizeL1, and instead supported that only in
	  CFPOF_DivisiveNormalizeL1 to avoid problems when CFPOF_Plugin was
	  used with anything but DivisiveNormalizeL1. Removed unused
	  DivisiveNormalizeL1_opt. The changes will affect the numerical
	  value of each activation pattern, at the six or seventh decimal
	  place total, due to using Numeric.sum in some cases and other sum
	  routines in others. This should also fix the various segfaults
	  that were possible when mixing and matching optimized and
	  non-optimized components.

	* [r4086] doc/User_Manual/parameters_text.php:
	  Fixed example

	* [r4085] doc/Links/index_text.php:
	  Fixed link

	* [r4084] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Made some parameters match those in miikkulainen:book05 better;
	  not yet tested

2006-08-02  ceball

	* [r4083] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Back to Composite for LGN weights, rather than separate
	  projections.

	* [r4082] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Take the number of connections into account during joint
	  normalization.

	* [r4081] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Fixed incorrect handling of cf.sum by CFPOF_Plugin; the problem
	  ultimately comes from elsewhere, probably.

	* [r4080] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Changed size parameter of Gaussians for projections to LGN (to
	  match the different definition of Gaussian in c++ lissom; c++
	  lissom divides by pi in the argument of exp in
	  RadialFunction::Gaussian but not in retinalobjs).

	* [r4079] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Reverted to separate center and surround projections for
	  debugging.

	* [r3861] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added task about allowing min_matrix_rad to be zero; altered task
	  about problem with examples/joublin_bc96.ty.

	* [r3860] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Removed a task.

	* [r3859] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  PyFloat_FromDouble() returns a new reference, so after using it
	  the reference count should be decremented.

	* [r3858] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  PyFloat_FromDouble() returns a new reference, so after using it
	  the reference count should be decremented.

	* [r3857] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Removed unused import.

	* [r3856] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Removed unused imports.

	* [r3855] topo/base/cf.py:
	  Added back line to update the CF's sum (that had been
	  accidentally removed in the past). If CFPOF_Plugin was being used
	  in combination with a CFPLF that selectively sets the _sum
	  attribute (as CFPLF_Hebbian_opt does, setting it only where the
	  output activity is not 0), then the sum could be out of date
	  while this line was missing.

	* [r3854] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Removed unnecessary call to super's init from
	  CPOF_DivisiveNormalizeL1_opt.

2006-06-02  jbednar

	  CFPRF_EuclideanDistance_opt

2006-06-02  ceball

	* [r3850] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  No visible change. Removed unnecessary __init__() method and
	  simplified code in DivisiveNormalizeL1_opt.

2006-06-02  jbednar

	* [r3849] topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/outputfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Cleaned up memory handling for PyObject calls from C code;
	  reference counts were increasing with each call, possibly leading
	  to memory leaks.

2006-06-01  jbednar

	* [r3848] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:

	  Rearranged and reassigned tasks now that Chris Ball is leaving

2006-06-01  judelaw

	  corrected errors in naming

2006-06-01  yschoe

	* [r3841] examples/leaky_lissom_or.ty:
	  Changed lateral connections to have LeakyCFProjection. Run this
	  example, and
	  use the test pattern generator (gaussian) to observe spiking.

	* [r3840] topo/sheets/slissom.py:
	  Added absolute refractory period to SLISSOM class. Use test
	  pattern generator
	  (gaussian) and repeatedly present the input to see the spiking.

2006-06-01  jbednar

	* [r3839] topo/base/functionfamilies.py,
	  topo/outputfns/basic.py,
	  topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Removed now-unused OutputFn return value

	* [r3838] topo/tests/testoutputfnsbasic.py,
	  topo/tests/testoutputfnsoptimized.py:

	  removing the return values

	* [r3837] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Removed unused Spike OutputFn

	* [r3836] topo/base/cf.py,

	  topo/patterns/basic.py,
	  topo/patterns/random.py,
	  topo/projections/basic.py,
	  topo/sheets/slissom.py:
	  Made calls to output_fns consistently use them in place rather
	  than as functions, which will allow the return value to be
	  removed

	* [r3835] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Minor documentation cleanup

	* [r3834] examples/Makefile:
	  Added som_retinotopy to standard examples to test with 'make all'

	* [r3833]
	  doc/Tutorials/som_retinotopy_text.php,
	  examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Made density be overridable from command line

	* [r3832] topo/base/arrayutils.py,
	  topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  At long last, fixed clip_in_place and related functions to use
	  matrix operations for speed and so that they operate cleanly in
	  place.

	* [r3831] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Fixed typo in commented-out code

2006-05-31  yschoe

	* [r3830] topo/responsefns/basic.py,
	  topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Removed DynamicThreshold_CFPRF_DotProduct_opt class from
	  responsefn.basic.
	  See sheets.slissom for the implementation of spiking.

	* [r3829] topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  Added hack alert. The stuff here needs to be removed or moved to
	  optimized.py

	* [r3828] examples/leaky_lissom_or.ty:
	  Moved spiking mechanism from responsefn to sheet (new class
	  SLISSOM).

	* [r3827] topo/sheets/slissom.py:
	  Spiking LISSOM sheet class, implementing dynamic thresholding.
	  For leaky
	  synapses, it needs the LeakyCFProjection class.

2006-05-31  jbednar

	* [r3826] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Made auto-refresh update the actual windows also, so that it
	  takes effect immediately even when called from a script. Also
	  made load_snapshot do an auto_refresh() to update any windows
	  that have auto-refresh enabled.

	* [r3825] topo/analysis/featuremap.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Greatly simplified display of the activity patterns during map
	  measurement, and now left it uncommented by default.

	* [r3824] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Increased size of default pattern for position preference
	  measurement so that it would be more likely to activate all
	  neurons; typically improves quality of position preference map.

2006-05-30  jbednar

	* [r3823] topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Removed redundant class

	* [r3822] examples/homeostatic.ty:
	  Fixed thresholds to be applied even on the first call, used
	  Numeric.sum() for averaging, and allowed bounds to be controlled
	  by parameters.

	* [r3821] examples/homeostatic.ty:
	  Updated with Veldri's changes: simple example of adjusting
	  threshold based on the average value in a rectangular window.
	  Reduced LGNOn density to make debugging easier. Fixed output_fn
	  for SharedWeightCFProjection.

	* [r3820] topo/outputfns/basic.py:

	* [r3816] examples/leaky_lissom_or.ty:
	  Modified a bit to make tsettle=1 and generate spikes using the
	  dynamic
	  threshold CFP function.

	* [r3815] topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  Added DynamicThreshold_CFPRF_DotProduct_opt, a
	  CFPRF_DotProduct_opt with
	  dynamic thresholding. Right now, it only has a fixed threshold.
	  It uses
	  the optimized __call__ in its parent, while the thresholding part
	  is plain
	  Python code.

	* [r3814] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Added a "primitive" Spike output function.

	  'on the grid' - previously it just set them both to 0.

2006-05-22  yschoe

	* [r3725] examples/leaky_lissom_or.ty:
	  Added leaky_lissom_or.ty to the source tree. This is a copy of
	  lissom_or.ty
	  with the afferent connections turned into LeakyCFProjection. The
	  lissom_or.ty
	  file will be periodically copied to leaky_lissom_or.ty and minor
	  edits made,
	  to keep future developments in lissom_or.ty independent of
	  leaky_lissom_or.ty.

	* [r3724] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added "kill" hotkey for plot windows (Control-q).

2006-05-22  jbednar

	* [r3723] etc/toporename:
	  Initial version

2006-05-22  yschoe

	* [r3722] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Fixed bug in LeakyCFProjection, and initialized
	  leaky_input_activity to a zero matrix.

	* [r3721] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Added activate() for LeakyCFProjection. A finer time-scale needs
	  to be
	  implemented.

2006-05-22  ceball

	* [r3720] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Uses Numeric's sum().

	* [r3719] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Uses Numeric's sum instead of Python's. This has a big impact on
	  the performance. Starting lissom_or (which uses
	  DivisiveSumNormalize_opt1 many times), this gives a the startup
	  time 65% of the previous time.

	* [r3718] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Shell prints new prompt everytime there simulation is run, as it
	  did before. Otherwise the prompt does not appear again after
	  messages are printed.

2006-05-21  ceball

	* [r3717] topo/tests/testtopoconsole.py:
	  Removed test that didn't have much use.

	* [r3716] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added some sample help messages.

	* [r3709] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Stopped shell printing a new prompt after every run command from
	  the GUI.

	* [r3708] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added '>>>' label to command prompt.

	* [r3707] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  'run for' displays 1.0 initially. 'commands' not displayed by
	  default.

	* [r3706] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  'Run for' is a TaggedSlider. String format needs to be adjusted,
	  and pressing enter should make the simulation run too.

	* [r3705] topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py:
	  TaggedSlider seems to assume a method optional_refresh() will
	  always exist on its parent; I put in a try/catch but the whole
	  thing (still) needs to be reviewed.

	* [r3704] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Corrected variable name.

	* [r3703] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Altered 'run simulation for group'. Changed how 'commands' group
	  is hidden. There are still some problems: width changes, not
	  enough padding in places.

	* [r3506] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Uses c++ response function. Now runs 3.5 times faster than
	  before.

	* [r3505] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Uses c++ shared weight response function.

	* [r3504] topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Added SharedWeightCFPDotProduct_opt1, as a speedier replacement
	  for SharedWeightCFPResponseFn(single_cf_fn=Mdot()). Also added
	  untested DotProduct_op1, Mdot in C++; it's not used anywhere, we
	  might just remove it.

	* [r3503] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  SharedWeightCFProjection needs to wrap its cfs list in a better
	  way, so we don't need separate response fns etc. But for now,
	  I've done this enough to allow a C++ replacement of the shared
	  weight response fn, which we badly need to improve performance.

	* [r3502] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated tasks.

	* [r3501] topo/base/sheet.py:

2006-05-05  ceball

	* [r3498] topo/base/sheetcoords.py:
	  Added comment (from JAB) about 'bounds-master' vs
	  'density-master' approaches.

	* [r3497] doc/User_Manual/space_text.php:
	  Initial attempt at describing 'bounds-master' approach to Sheet
	  bounds/density.

	* [r3496] topo/base/simulation.py:
	  Made the saved_commands Simulation Parameter be instantiated
	  (it's specific to one Simulation object); this isn't very
	  important since most users will not have more than one
	  Simulation. Removed two HACKALERTs.

	* [r3495] topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/eps/basic.py,
	  topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  Cleaned up enqueue_event* methods. This could probably be
	  simplified further. Events must have a time.

	  Cleaned up a little.

	* [r3493] topo/base/simulation.py,
	  topo/commands/pylabplots.py:

	  about upgrading Numeric and a link to Numeric's convertcode.py.

	* [r3484] topo/base/arrayutils.py,
	  topo/base/functionfamilies.py:
	  Removed mdot() function - there is the Mdot ResponseFn in
	  topo.responsefns.basic. Moved comment about weave.blitz from mdot
	  to Mdot.

	* [r3483] topo/base/arrayutils.py:
	  Removed unused and potentially misleading msum() function.

2006-05-04  ceball

	* [r3482] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  PatternSampler (and hence CompositePatternGenerator and Image) is
	  based on SheetCoordinateSystem with an activity matrix, rather
	  than on Sheet.

	* [r3481] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Corrected learning rates, added missing scheduled action, and
	  commented out final weights bounds change.

	* [r3480] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Updated for recent changes to code.

	* [r3479] doc/Downloads/index_text.php:
	  Added commented-out section (for JAB to decide whether or not
	  it's worthwhile to include) about problems with cvs, with a link
	  to SourceForge's status page.

	* [r3478] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Adjusted times which I'd changed by mistake earlier. Altered some
	  comments. Appears to match c++ lissom after 201 iterations (i.e.
	  after the first set of scheduled actions).

	* [r3477] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Corrected mistake left in previous version by mistake.

	* [r3476] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Forget to divide min_exc_rad by BaseN.

	  topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty,
	  topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty,
	  topo/tests/testlissom.ty:
	  For a CFProjection, users specify the BoundingRegionParameter
	  user_weights_bounds. The actual weights_bounds are stored in the
	  attribute weights_bounds.

	* [r3471] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Added min_exc_rad.

	* [r3470] topo/misc/tyimputil.py:

	  For editing sheet and projection classes, a new window opens.
	  This at least makes the model editor ok for creating sheets and
	  projections.

	  Minor change to comment.

2006-05-03  ceball

	* [r3452] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Minor changes to notes.

	* [r3451] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Removed some commented-out code about DynamicNumber. If
	  DynamicNumbers display strangely in ParametersFrames, then it
	  might be because I commented out this code before - so it may be
	  necessary to restore it. For now, though, I don't remember what
	  it was for.

	* [r3450] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Tidied imports.

	  Intermediate checkin. Model editor can now set all parameters on
	  sheet and projection classes before they're instantiated. Not
	  fully tested, not finished, and might be a regression in some
	  areas.

	* [r3444] topo/misc/utils.py:
	  Removed some string translation functions.

	* [r3430] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Improved TestPattern so that the reduce, enlarge and sheetcoords
	  button ar working. There is still a problem remaining for
	  integerscaling button: when it is on, and that we try to reduce,
	  we obtain a Division by Zero error.

	* [r3325] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Removed erroneous statement in one of the tasks.

	* [r3324] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Changed CFProjection.initialize_bounds() so that it avoids
	  floating-point representation difficulties. Specifically, it uses
	  bounds2slice() to get the right and bottom values of the slice,
	  then mirrors these about the center of the slice to get the left
	  and top values - ensuring the slice is odd. Updated
	  CF.offset_bounds() so that it does not assume the bounds it
	  receives are centered at (0,0) on the Sheet. These alterations
	  could affect the behaviour of existing networks; the reference
	  simulations show no change.

	* [r3323] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Made set_slice be available outside the Slice class, temporarily.

	* [r3322] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  Added method to BoundingBox that results the coordinates of the
	  center of the bounds.

	* [r3321] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Commented out test of bounds2slice() that fails because of the
	  floating point representation of these particular bounds.

	* [r3320] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Raises a ValueError if the weights matrix ends up with a
	  zero-sized dimension.

	* [r3319] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added assert statement (assert that the weights matrix is odd).

	  Minor update to comment.

	* [r3290] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Updated learning rates (before bounds change).

	* [r3289] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Changed CFProjection's initialize_bounds() to move the bounds to

	  Updated a task.

	* [r3287] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Added note that random streams don't appear to be pickled such
	  that they resume where they left off.

	* [r3286] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added HACKALERT.

	* [r3285] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:

	  Removed a task! About pickling!

	* [r3283] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Added startup command to allow V1 still to be referred to.

	* [r3282] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Instead of pickle.Pickler and pickle.Unpickler, use our custom
	  Pickler and Unpickler.

	* [r3281] topo/misc/utils.py:
	  Added new Pickler and Unpickler, used at the moment to save array
	  savespace setting.

	* [r3280] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  No visible change: switched from using pickle's load() and dump()

	  Removed unused import.

2006-04-25  ceball

	  Updated slightly

2006-04-25  ceball

	* [r3276] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Finished part of a task.

	* [r3275] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Removed hack from load_snapshot().

	* [r3274] topo/misc/utils.py:
	  Set class attributes on true class rather than on the name we
	  might be using for a class.

2006-04-25  jbednar

	* [r3273] doc/Developer_Manual/coding_text.php,
	  doc/Developer_Manual/optimization_text.php,
	  doc/Reference_Manual/index_text.php:
	  Minor fixes and clarifications

	* [r3272] doc/User_Manual/images,
	  doc/User_Manual/images/.cvsignore:
	  Minor fix

2006-04-24  ceball

	* [r3271] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated a task.

	* [r3270] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Added a hack to avoid a problem with unpickling when Topographica
	  was pickled after falling back to non-optimized components.

	* [r3269] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added a task.

	* [r3268] topo/tests/testsimulator.py:
	  Updated test with new class name.

	* [r3267] examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Adds a command to the simulator's startup_commands.

	* [r3266] topo/base/simulator.py,
	  topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Added startup_commands Parameter to Simulator. Altered
	  topo.commands.basic's save_snapshot() and load_snapshot() so that
	  these commands are executed before the simulator is unpickled.
	  Now scheduled actions can be pickled and unpickled without
	  difficulty.

	* [r3265] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added a task about correcting things causing pickling to fail.
	  Added task about adding a set of more in-depth tests, distinct
	  from the quick-to-run tests.

	* [r3264] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated my tasks.

	* [r3263] doc/Future_Work/index_text.php:

	  Updated my tasks, including marking those that need to be
	  completed before the next release.

	* [r3259] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Changed to use schedule_command() instead of schedule_action().

	* [r3258] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Added more helpful printing in the case of a SyntaxError for
	  CommandEvent.

	* [r3257] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Added Event class, and EPEvent and CommandEvent subclasses (as
	  well as SAEVent class which will be removed when all uses of
	  schedule_action() in the examples are removed). There is one
	  change to the logic in Simulator.run(): now did_event is set to
	  True no matter what type of Event is called (rather than just for
	  SimulatorEvents without 'fn' attribute, as before). I don't think
	  this affects the behaviour.

2006-04-24  jbednar

	* [r3256] doc/User_Manual,
	  doc/User_Manual/.cvsignore,
	  doc/User_Manual/index_text.php,
	  doc/User_Manual/modeleditor_text.php:

	* [r3255] doc/User_Manual/model_editor.html:
	  Moved to model_editor_text.php

	* [r3254] doc/Future_Work/index_text.php:
	  Fixed stray comment ender that was giving garbage text at the end
	  of the page

	* [r3253] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Clarified documentation

	* [r3252] doc/shared/index.php:
	  Added more keywords to title

2006-04-24  ceball

	* [r3251] examples/hierarchical.ty:
	  Changed scheduled action example to use schedule_command(), which
	  allows the network to be pickled before all the scheduled actions
	  have occurred.

	* [r3250] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Added ScheduledCommand class and schedule_command() for exec'ing
	  an arbitrary string in __main__.__dict__ at a specified time.
	  Added some HACKALERTs (about scheduling commands).

	* [r3249] examples/hierarchical.ty:
	  Added an example scheduled action.

	* [r3248] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Added comment. Added HACKALERT.

	* [r3247] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Clarified a HACKALERT.

	* [r3246] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Added HACKALERT about SimulatorEvent.

	* [r3245] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Removed erroneous cropping of rf_radius to an integer.

	* [r3244] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Mask size set from the original, user-specified weights_bounds,
	  rather than the weights_bounds that may have been adjusted to be
	  odd-sized. Still need to change to have user-specified
	  weights_bounds as the Parameter user_weights_bounds.

2006-04-23  jbednar

	* [r3243] Makefile:
	  Added automatic ChangeLog creation

	* [r3242] ChangeLog.txt:
	  Updated with recent changes

2006-04-23  ceball

	  doc/Developer_Manual/imports_text.php:
	  Fixed minor typo.

2006-04-22  ceball

	  Added translate() method to Slice.

2006-04-21  ceball

	* [r3237] topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Corrected typo in the code that was stopping Topographica running
	  without weave.

	* [r3236] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Removed a task!

	* [r3235] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed a HACKALERT and the corresponding HACK.

	* [r3234] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed an assert statement from get_view().

	* [r3233] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  get_view() asks for cf's slice directly, rather than getting
	  bounds and calculating the slice.

	* [r3232] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Removed get_view() because there is no longer any need to
	  override the superclass's version.

	* [r3231] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed another print statement that I left in by mistake.

	* [r3230] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  SharedWeight's cf(r,c) method now returns the cf with the
	  appropriate bounds.

	* [r3229] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed commented-out print statements left in by mistake.

	* [r3228] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Corrected typo.

	* [r3227] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated my tasks; started to put them in some kind of order (in
	  which I'm doing them).

2006-04-20  ceball

	* [r3226] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added HACKALERT about location of CoordinateTransformer.

	* [r3225] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Moved _check_params to ParameterizedObject, where I meant to put
	  it originally.

	* [r3224] topo/patterns/random.py:
	  __call__() checks that its arguments are Parameters.

	* [r3223] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Moved code that checks arguments of __call__() are Parameters to
	  its own method; added call to that method to Constant.

	* [r3222] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  PatternGenerator uses a CoordinateTransformer method to get
	  pattern sampling vectors.

	* [r3221] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added method to return the sheet coordinate x-centers and
	  y-centers of the underlying matrix cells of a
	  CoordinateTransformer.

2006-04-20  julienciroux

	* [r3220] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Fixed projectionpanel and corrected errors in connectionfield
	  panel. There is still a warning when opening the connectionfield
	  panel, it has to be sorted.

	* [r3219] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py:
	  Corrected display of the sheet_name while looking into history.

2006-04-20  ceball

	* [r3218] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Minor update after change to Sheet.

	* [r3217] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Continued to update recent work CoordinateTransformer. Equalizing
	  the densities by adjusting bounds is now an option on creating a
	  CoordinateTransformer, and is True by default for Sheets.

2006-04-20  julienciroux

	* [r3216] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py:
	  Corrected the double call to refresh in the __init__, and got rid
	  of the FocusOut action for the xy boxes.

	* [r3215] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py:
	  Got rid of now unuseful chain import.

2006-04-20  ceball

	* [r3214] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Minor updates to use of Slice and CoordinateTransformer.

2006-04-20  julienciroux

	* [r3213] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Corrected handling of integerscaling.

	* [r3212] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Added a parameter looking_in_history that indicates if we are
	  currently looking back in time. Fixed the handling of the
	  checkbuttons when hitting back and forward.

2006-04-20  ceball

	* [r3211] topo/patterns/random.py:
	  Random generators get shape from CoordinateTransformer, rather
	  than from a Slice. Removed Slice from imports.

	* [r3210] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Constant gets shape from CoordinateTransformer, rather than from
	  a Slice. Removed Slice from imports.

	* [r3209] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated my tasks.

	* [r3208] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  PatternGenerator uses matrixidx2sheet_array()

	* [r3207] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Added some comments.

	* [r3206] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added matrixidx2sheet_array() and updated some comments.

2006-04-20  julienciroux

	* [r3205] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added a method restaure_environment in PlotGroup panel to
	  re-instate the state of the buttons when re-loading a Plotgroup
	  from the history.

	* [r3204] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Corrected the handling of the history so that it act properly
	  when hitting refresh or auto-refresh.

	* [r3203] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Corrected the saving of the history so that we do not update a
	  PlotGroup in the past.

	* [r3202] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed the handling of the history: now a copy of the plotgroup
	  is kept in history instead of bitmaps. It still needs more work.

2006-04-20  ceball

	* [r3201] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Simplified code committed in the last version.

	* [r3200] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Where xdensity==ydensity, CoordinateTransformers are created by
	  passing just one density.

	* [r3199] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Can create a CoordinateTransformer by specifying only one density
	  if xdensity==ydensity.

	* [r3198] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated my tasks.

	* [r3197] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated my tasks.

	* [r3196] topo/tests/testimage.py,
	  topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py:
	  Uses xdensity and ydensity in the tests, rather than just
	  density. Only tests cases where they're equal, though.

	* [r3195] topo/tests/testcfsom.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheetview.py:
	  Commented out the ImageGenerator class. Tests using it will be
	  resurrected in an equivalent form using the Image class.

	* [r3194] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Updated after changes to sheet.py (introduction of
	  CoordinateTransformer). Some further changes will be required
	  when CoordinateTransformer is changed some more...

	* [r3193] topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotgroup.py:
	  Removed unused import statement.

	* [r3192] topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  The image generator is passed xdensity and ydensity (both equal,
	  since for a sheet these are equal).

	* [r3191] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Uses Slice and CoordinateTransformer.

	* [r3190] topo/patterns/random.py:
	  Uses xdensity and ydensity, and the Slice object.

	* [r3189] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Uses xdensity and ydensity.

	* [r3188] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  PatternSampler uses xdensity and ydensity. This is an
	  intermediate checkin - needs to be cleaned up.

	* [r3187] topo/learningfns/som.py:
	  Uses xdensity and ydensity in call to pattern generator.

	* [r3186] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Calls matrix2sheet() as a method of the sheet being considered.

	* [r3185] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Part-way checkin. Uses the Slice object, but more of the
	  calculations in PatternGenerator will move to the Slice object.

	* [r3184] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Uses the Slice and CoordinateTransformer classes. Some of the
	  calculations in here will move to the Slice object (e.g.
	  translation of a slice).

	* [r3183] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Part-way checkin. Created CoordinateTransformer class, which
	  contains methods that were previously coordinate-transforming
	  functions in this file. Updated the Slice object. Still have to
	  move some methods from CoordinateTransformer to Slice, and
	  finalize other aspects.

2006-04-19  julienciroux

	* [r3182] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Deleted the attribute sheet_filter_lam of a PlotGroup in order to
	  be able to deep copy a PlotGroup.

	* [r3181] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Corrected the _set_height_of_tallest_plot and the scale_images
	  method for a ProjectionPlotGroup.

2006-04-19  ceball

	* [r3180] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Replaced the untested CompositePatternGenerator with a new,
	  untested CompositePatternGenerator. This one is simpler.

2006-04-19  julienciroux

	* [r3179] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Added a parameter update when calling display_plots (decide
	  wether re-generating the Sheetviews or not.

	* [r3178] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Minor change in doc and comment.

2006-04-19  ceball

	* [r3177] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Get cf.slice_array rather than calling cf.slice_tuple(). (This
	  was part of an earlier change, but does not seem to have been
	  committed.)

2006-04-18  ceball

	* [r3176] topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  Removed unnecessary setting of bounds and density. Removed out of
	  date HACKALERT.

2006-04-15  ceball

	* [r3175] topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py:
	  File is now a reasonable test of PatternGenerator.

	* [r3174] topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py:
	  Added more tests.

	* [r3173] topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py:
	  Updated test.

	* [r3172] topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py:
	  Changed the test so that it actually does what was intended
	  (previously the 'assert' statement was not testing anything about
	  the arrays). Currently it fails but this might be because the
	  test itself is wrong.

2006-04-14  ceball

	* [r3171] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/projections/basic.py,
	  topo/responsefns/projfns.py:
	  Removed cf's slice_tuple() method. Going to rename slice_array to
	  slice_. slice_ being an array does not make it awkward to access
	  the elements since Python automatically unpacks array values
	  anyway.

	* [r3170] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Removed an outdated HACKALERT.

2006-04-14  julienciroux

	* [r3169] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Minor re-organization; deleted self.bitmaps.

	* [r3168] topo/plotting/bitmap.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Delete the attribute plot_src_name and name for a Bitmap (Not
	  needed anymore). Delete the PlotGroup load_images method, now we
	  explicitly built the bitmap list in PlotGroupPanel
	  display_plots().

	* [r3167] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Moved the generation of the plot labels to PlotGroup; it will
	  enable getting rid of the copy of plot_src_name and name from
	  Plot to Bitmap, and eventually getting rid of the direct use of
	  Bitmaps objects.

	* [r3166] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Re-organized order in the file, added alert.

	* [r3165] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Deleted unused import statements.

	* [r3164] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Temporary hack to fix back and forward buttons.

	* [r3163] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Minor re-organization of the __init__ method.

	* [r3162] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added a second control frame for Back, Forward, Sheetcoordinates
	  and Integerscaling Buttons. Moved the Sheetcoords button from
	  templateplotgrouppanel to plotgrouppanel. Deleted old comments.

	* [r3161] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Deleted the scale_images() method in PlotGroupPanel. Now the
	  scaling is done within PlotGroup. Also deleted unused import
	  statements and old alerts and update doc.

2006-04-13  julienciroux

	* [r3160] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added two ALERTS.

2006-04-13  ceball

	* [r3158] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Deleted the attribute plotgroup_key of a PlotGroup.

2006-04-13  ceball

	* [r3157] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Get sheet's shape from sheet's activity matrix shape.

	* [r3156] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Use sheet methods bounds2slice() and slice2bounds().

	* [r3155] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added sheet methods bounds2slice() and slice2bounds().

	* [r3154] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Minor changes to documentation.

	* [r3153] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Enforce minimum number of units in each direction to be 1; rename
	  slice variable to slice_; changes to documentation.

	* [r3152] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Deleted two unused import statement.

	* [r3151] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Got rid of the use of dict_sort. Now the ordering of the plot is
	  performed differently.

	* [r3150] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Deleted the import statement for flatten and change the code that
	  was using it.

2006-04-13  ceball

	* [r3149] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Small change to documentation.

	* [r3148] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  No visible change - small tidy up.

	* [r3147] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  Minor change to documentation.

	* [r3146] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Moved __doc__ definition higher up in the Parameter class so it
	  is a bit more obvious. Added check that subclasses of Parameter
	  define __slots__.

	* [r3145] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Added __slots__ and __doc__ to EventProcessorParameter.

	* [r3144] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  Added __slots__ and __doc__ to BoundingRegionParameter.

	* [r3143] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Updated Sheet documentation a bit.

2006-04-13  julienciroux

	* [r3142] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Replaced the import statement for the commands within
	  templateplotgrouppanel, and import them in __main__.__dict__.
	  They laso are executed in __main__.__dict__ from the PlotGroups.

2006-04-13  ceball

	* [r3141] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Removed unused functions slicearray2bounds() and
	  bounds2slicearray(). All slices will be arrays eventually, but
	  for now they are Python tuples.

2006-04-13  julienciroux

	* [r3140] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Deleted unused import statements.

2006-04-13  ceball

	* [r3139] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Removed xdensity and ydensity from current Composite class (which
	  will be replaced anyway).

	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Deleted the plotgroup_dict variable: now each panel create and
	  store its own plotgroup attribute and uses it accordingly. Added
	  a method generate_sheet_views to the PlotGroups: now the command
	  to update the sheet view is contained in PlotGroups (and still
	  can be modified from the panel). It is the first version without
	  plotgroup_dict, it needs some cleaning and improving (in
	  particular for the projectionpanel and testpattern).

2006-04-13  ceball

	* [r3137] topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Removed xdensity and ydensity. Except in the documentation.

	* [r3136] topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  slice2bounds() does not use xdensity and ydensity.

	* [r3135] topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/commands/analysis.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  matrix2sheet() does not use xdensity and ydensity.

	* [r3134] topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  sheet2matrix() and sheet2matrixidx() don't use xdensity and
	  ydensity.

	* [r3133] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Altered a test; no visible change.

	* [r3132] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Uncommented a test case that I'd previously left commented out by
	  mistake.

2006-04-12  ceball

	* [r3131] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  crop_slice_to_sheet() doesn't use xdensity and ydensity.

	* [r3130] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Removed unused import.

	* [r3129] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  submatrix() just takes density.

	* [r3128] topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  bounds2slice() just uses density, not xdensity and ydensity.

	* [r3127] topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py:
	  Only one line was in the test, so I commented that one too.

	* [r3126] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Removed xdensity and ydensity. Adjusted the corresponding
	  HACKALERT.

	* [r3125] topo/base/functionfamilies.py:
	  Initial version.

	* [r3124] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py,

	  topo/projections/basic.py,
	  topo/tests/testimage.py:
	  Moved OutputFn, OutputFnParameter, and Identity to
	  functionfamilies (from projection). Renamed Identity to
	  IdentityOF.

	* [r3123] topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  Import the basic response functions.

	* [r3122] topo/responsefns/projfns.py:
	  Removed unnecessary __init__()s. Use ResponseFnParameter for
	  single_cf_fn.

	* [r3121] topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Removed unnecessary __init__(). Use ResponseFnParameter.

	* [r3120] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Use ResponseFnParameter.

	* [r3119] topo/base/arrayutils.py,
	  topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Moved Mdot() to connectionfield.py and made it a LearningFn. Made
	  ResponseFnParameter.

	* [r3118] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Changed a sum() of the weights to Numeric.sum(). Numeric.sum() is
	  faster. (Python's sum() and Numeric's sum() appear to give
	  slightly different results in general, though this particular
	  change makes no difference at the moment.)

2006-04-12  julienciroux

	* [r3117] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Minor re-organization of the __init__.

	* [r3116] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py,

	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Added arguments sheetcoords and integersaling to the PlotGroup
	  constructor. Renamed plotgroup() to refresh_plotgroup() in
	  PlotGroupPanel and subclasses. Now, refresh_plotgroup() is only
	  called from the refresh method, and I added an attribute
	  self.plotgroup that stores the current PlotGroup. Also deleted
	  old code in PlotGroupPanel.

	* [r3114] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Deleted old comments; improved two lines of code.

	* [r3112] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated my tasks.

	* [r3111] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed xdensity and ydensity, just using density now.

	* [r3110] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Intermediate checkin. Removing xdensity and ydensity gradually.

	* [r3109] topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/patterns/random.py:
	  PatternGenerators only accept density as a single number.

	* [r3108] topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  Only passes density, not xdensity and ydensity, to
	  PatternGenerator for creating the input pattern.

	* [r3107] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Removed test of bounds2slice() that deliberately uses different x
	  and y densities.

	* [r3106] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Added a test for Sheet creation where the specified bounds and
	  density would not give a sheet with the same density along x as
	  along y.

	* [r3105] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Changed a HACKALERT.

	* [r3104] topo/plotting/bitmap.py,
	  topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Got rid of the attribute resize for the bitmap, and added it to
	  Plot objects.

	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Moved everything not special to the GUI from PlotGroupPanel to
	  PlotGroup (e.g. sale_images, _set_height_of_tallest_plot). Also
	  deleted the old do_plot_cmd, by a plotgroup() method that
	  regenrates the PlotGroup anytime from the panels. It is a first
	  version that have been committed in order to be further
	  simplified. Note also that there is a slight bug for the
	  ProjectionPanel and for the handling of the SheetCoordinates
	  check_button, but they will be fixed very soon.

2006-04-11  ceball

	* [r3102] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Sheet has same density in x and y directions (by adjusting height
	  of BoundingBox if necessary. Intermediate checkin: still have to
	  removed xdensity and ydensity from the code, and update the
	  documentation.

	* [r3101] examples/Makefile:
	  Sets default_density to be smaller before running each example.

	* [r3100] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Allowed cortical density to be set externally via default_density
	  variable (otherwise uses the value set in the file).

	* [r3099] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editortools.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Colours of sheets changed (together) by setting the canvas' mode.
	  No lateral button in sheet's property panel, just a list of
	  connections (opens their properties). Auto refresh and normalize
	  options in the canvas.

	  First draft user guide for the model editor. Does not link to
	  other sections and does not conform to the style of the other
	  pages.

2006-04-11  jbednar

	* [r3097] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Fix by Chris -- override default Sheet bounds and density to be
	  sure it's the ones we expect

	* [r3096] /trunk/topographica, .cvsignore:
	  Added missing newline

2006-04-11  ceball

	* [r3095] topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  Removed projection-level response functions (they are in
	  projfns.py.

	* [r3094] topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Updated CFProjectionResponseFn imports to be from projfns.

	* [r3093] topo/responsefns/projfns.py:
	  Renamed basic.py to projfns.py since it contains only
	  projection-level response functions.

2006-04-10  ceball

	* [r3092] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Re-enabled a test that I disabled. This version, revision 1.25,
	  is identical to revision 1.23. I disabled the test when I changed
	  how the tests are run, because it began failing with no change
	  other than the test-running mechanism (and had not been failing
	  before). As far as I could tell, the test was running properly
	  and not failing before I changed the testing mechanism, so I
	  decided to comment out the test and investigate later on. I am
	  re-enabling the test because it is legitimately failing. I'm not
	  sure what is going on: was it not running before? How could it
	  not have been failing? The functions it is testing have not
	  changed throughout this process, so I am confused. Maybe we all
	  had *.pyc files left that were not updated, though that seems
	  unlikely.

	* [r3091] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Added commented-out new version of CompositePatternGenerator.
	  Corrected import statements (including for when new
	  CompositePatternGenerator is uncommented.

	  Attempting to organize functions that iterate over the CFs of a
	  CFProjection and those that act on a single array.

	  (As part of the more general idea that there are e.g. output
	  functions
	  which apply to a Projection.)

	  For output functions, we have the single-array (normal
	  mathematical) output
	  functions, e.g.:
	  OutputFn
	  Identity
	  DivisiveSumNormalize
	  We also have the functions that iterate through a CFProjection's
	  CFs,
	  applying an OutputFn to each:
	  CFProjectionOuputFn
	  CFProjectionIdentityOutputFn(single_cf_fn=Identity())
	  CFProjectionDivisiveSumNormalize(single_cf_fn=DivisiveSumNormalize())

	  OutputFns are in topo.outputfns.basic, and CFProjectionOutputFns
	  are
	  in topo.outputfns.projfns. Other Projection-level output
	  functions
	  would also go in the projfns module.

	  The same applies to LearningFns and
	  CFProjectionLearningFns. ResponseFunctions have been renamed
	  CFProjectionResponseFunctions where they apply to a CFProjection.
	  The
	  reorganization of LearningFns and ResponseFns is not complete
	  yet.

	  Along with this reorganization, CFProjectionOutputFnParameter (as
	  distinct from OutputFnParameter) has been introduced (and
	  similarly
	  for LearningFns). Implementation of these is not complete yet;
	  notably
	  the __init__.py files in the outputfns, learningfns, and
	  responsefns
	  packages need to be cleaned up.

	  In addition to this, minor cleanups may also have occurred,
	  including:
	  skipping calls to __init__() methods if all they do is call the
	  superclass' __init__()s; documentation strings.

	* [r3085] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Updated documentation for ClassSelectorParameter.

	* [r3084] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added CFOutputFunctionParameter class; made weights_output_fn be
	  a CFOutputFunctionParameter.

	* [r3083] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  GenericCFOF: removed __init__() method, since it does nothing but
	  call the superclass'. Made single_cf_fn parameter be an
	  OutputFunctionParameter.

	* [r3082] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Minor clean-up of comments.

	* [r3081] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  CFOutputFunction is abstract.

	* [r3080] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Updated docstring.

	* [r3079] topo/outputfns/projfns.py:
	  Initial version.

	* [r3078] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:

	* [r3076] topo/commands/basic.py,
	  topo/misc/utils.py:
	  Minor changes to pickling - should be no visible change.

	* [r3075] topo/tests/__init__.py:
	  Allowed a test to be ignored easily. Removed testsnapshots from
	  the automatic tests.

	* [r3074] topo/tests/testsnapshots.py:
	  Initial version.

	* [r3073] topo/tests/__init__.py:

	* [r3072] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Updated docstrings for save_ and load_snapshot

	* [r3071] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  When being pickled, the simulator has its RELEASE attribute set
	  to topo.release.

	* [r3070]
	  topo/tests/testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added missing import statement.

	* [r3069] topo/tests/tkgui:
	  Removing directory.

	* [r3068] topo/tests/__init__.py:
	  Updated doc string, added ALERT about structure of tests/

	  topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py:
	  Reduced sheet densities.

	* [r3065]
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Spelt 'density' correctly this time.

	* [r3064]
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Reduced sheet densities to speed up tests.

	* [r3063] topo/analysis/featuremap.py,
	  topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Removed calls to active_sim() and some passing round of
	  simulators.

	* [r3062] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Removed a HACKALERT and the corresponding call to active_sim().

	* [r3061] topo/tests/testfeaturemap.py:
	  Reduced density of sheets in test_measurefeaturemap(). It runs a
	  lot faster now.

2006-04-07  julienciroux

	* [r3060] topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py:
	  Deleted cfsheetplotpanel.py: the code is now in both
	  connectionfield and projection panels.

	* [r3059] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Added the code of cfsheetplotpanel in projectionpanel and made it
	  inherit from TemplatePlotGroupPanel instead

	* [r3058] topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Modified the __init__ method: call refresh only if it is an
	  instance of TemplatePlotGroupPanel. Allow calling the constructor
	  for subclasses.

	* [r3057] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py:
	  Added the code of cfsheetplotpanel in connectionfieldpanel and
	  made it inherit from TemplatePlotGroupPanel instead

2006-04-07  ceball

	* [r3056] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated my tasks.

	* [r3055] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Removed TopoImage, which I forgot to do on the previous commit.

	* [r3054] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Removed the TopoImage class and a related HACKALERT. Images are
	  now loaded only once, rather than every time Image's function()
	  is called.

2006-04-07  julienciroux

	* [r3053] topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py:
	  temporary hack to get the normalize button set properly for a
	  connectionfieldspanel and a projectionpanel. It will be properly
	  sorted when getting rid of CFSheetPlotPanel and correcting the
	  hierarchy of the panels.

2006-04-07  ceball

	* [r3052] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Added HACKALERT.

	* [r3051] topo/patterns/basic.py,
	  topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Corrected mistake in PatternSampler where background value was
	  being calculated before array was normalized.

2006-04-07  julienciroux

	* [r3050] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Renamed _set_initial_master_zoom to _set_eight_of_tallest_plot.

	* [r3049] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Corrected self.zoom_factor to be self.height_of_tallest_plot and
	  INITIAL_PLOT_WIDTH to INITIAL_PLOT_HEIGHT. Added a
	  re-implementation of the _set_initial_naster_zoom for the
	  projectionpanel (that needs more work).

2006-04-07  ceball

	* [r3048] topo/patterns/basic.py,
	  topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Moved PatternSampler class from topo/patterns/image.py to
	  topo/patterns/basic.py in anticipation of using it for Composite.
	  This might not be the correct final location for PatternSampler.

	* [r3047] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Created a new class, PatternSampler, which does the sampling of a
	  pattern that TopoImage did previously. TopoImage is now a
	  subclass of PatternSampler.

2006-04-07  julienciroux

	* [r3046] topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py:
	  Corrected error in cfsheetplotpanel (forgot to change the name of
	  self.zoom_factor to self.height_of_tallest_plot and
	  self.min_zoom_factor to self.min_master_zoom); that should fix
	  the connectionfieldpanel.

	* [r3045] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Replaced self.master_zoom by self.height_of_tallest_plot.

2006-04-07  ceball

	* [r3044] topo/tests/__init__.py,
	  topo/tests/tkgui/__init__.py:
	  Any file named test*.py that defines the 'suite' attribute will
	  be included when the tests are run.

	* [r3043] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Commented out a test which is out of date. Will be updated when
	  sheet.py and connectionfield.py are reviewed.

2006-04-06  julienciroux

	* [r3042] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  simplified the function _set_initial_plot_zoom; now there is only
	  one master_zoom. Deleted the function _compute_max_height.

	* [r3041] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Corrected the function scale image; renamed self.min_zoom_factor
	  to self.min_master_zoom.

	  Added 'topographica.bat' (which exists after installation on
	  Windows).

	* [r3039] topo/tests/testimage.py:
	  Added more tests.

2006-04-06  julienciroux

	* [r3038] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Implement a master_zoom for both sheet coordinates and matrix
	  coordinates.

2006-04-06  ceball

	* [r3037] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  User-specified numbers involved in divisions are first turned to
	  floats in case integer
	  values are specified.

	* [r3036] topo/tests/testimage.py:
	  Altered HACKALERT.

2006-04-05  ceball

	* [r3035] topo/tests/__init__.py:
	  testimage.py added to the list of tests. Currently one test is
	  failing, because of a mistake in image.py version 1.40; this will
	  be corrected in the next version of image.py.

	* [r3034] topo/tests/testimage.py:
	  Continued writing.

	* [r3033] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Removed an out-of-date HACKALERT.

	* [r3032] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Altered a HACKALERT.

	* [r3031] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Size scaling of each of the image dimensions is done relative to
	  the default retinal dimension of 1.0, rather than the current
	  sheet's dimension.

	* [r3030] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Corrected typo in documentation.

	* [r3029] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Changed previous output_fn to 'whole_image_output_fn (needs a
	  better name), so that there can also be an output_fn to apply to
	  the section of image that is actually displayed (i.e. the meaning
	  of output_fn for other PatternGenerators).

	* [r3028] topo/patterns/random.py:
	  Added output_fn to PatternGenerators in random.py. Switched order
	  of import statements.

	* [r3027] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Added output_fn to Constant.

	* [r3026] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  PatternGenerators have an OutputFunctionParameter.

	* [r3025] topo/base/projection.py:
	  OutputFunction is an abstract class.

	* [r3024] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Corrected test for whether or not an argument supplied to
	  __call__() is a Parameter. Added commented-out code for an
	  output_fn on PatternGenerator (so this change is separate from
	  the first one).

	* [r3023] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Updated some documentation.

	* [r3022] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Added a warning to __call__() of PatternGenerator if a value is
	  passed for something that does not exist as a Parameter.

	* [r3021] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  No visible change, just switched order of import statements.

	* [r3020] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Allowed to specifiy scale and offset when calling
	  PatternGenerator (altered ConstantGenerator in the same way).

	* [r3019] topo/tests/testimage.pgm:
	  Changed to have one even dimension and one odd dimension.

	* [r3018] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Simplified the TopoImage class by using a Sheet as the container
	  for an image. That way, coordinate transforms can work using the
	  standard sheet.py functions. Also, altered how the initial image
	  scaling works (it remains to make the initial
	  scaling relative to the default 1.0 retinal area, rather than the
	  current retina).

	* [r3017] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added a version of sheet2matrixidx() that works for arrays. (All
	  these functions still
	  have to be cleaned up into the Slice class.)

	* [r3016] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  Added contains_exclusive(), which is the same as contains()
	  except the right and bottom boundaries of the BoundingBox are
	  considered exclusive.

2006-04-05  jbednar

	* [r3015] ChangeLog.txt:
	  Updated with recent changes

	* [r3014]
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Fixed broken test uncovered by better error messages

2006-04-05  ceball

	* [r3013] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Added 'sum' argument to Identity.

	* [r3012] topo/tests/testimage.py,
	  topo/tests/utils.py:
	  Initial version.

	* [r3011] topo/tests/testimage.pgm:
	  An image to use for testing the image generator in image.py.

2006-03-29  julienciroux

	* [r3010] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Started to re-write scale_images: got rid of the arbitrary factor
	  10 in the case of sheet coordinate scaling; now the largest
	  bitmap is scaled to INITIAL_PLOT_HEIGHT in any cases. It remains
	  to implement a master zoom for each case.

	* [r3009] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py:
	  Corrected label display for connection field panel accordingly to
	  the new changes in the UnitView plot_src_name attribute.

	* [r3008] topo/base/sheetview.py:
	  Made the plot_src_name attribute beeing set to the src sheet name
	  for a UnitView as well, (it is a necessary step in order to
	  implement the sheet coordinates button for the connection field
	  panel).

2006-03-29  ceball

	* [r3007] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Removed a line (unused) that I left in by accident one time.

2006-03-29  jbednar

	* [r3006] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Made Integer scaling button refresh automatically

	* [r3005] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Fixed typo in comment

2006-03-28  julienciroux

	* [r3004] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Corrected mistake in toogle_normalize (without a call to
	  scale_images, the Plot are not regenerated.)

	* [r3003] topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Set the attribute normalize according to the value for the
	  template (for a TemplatePlotGroupPanel).

	* [r3002] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Corrected Plot creation in the TestPattern, according to the new
	  changes in Plot.

	* [r3001] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Got rid of the situate argument for plot: now it is all
	  determined by the plot_bounding_box.

	* [r3000] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testplot.py:
	  Changed Plot: now that UnitViews shared the same bounds as the
	  SheetViews, there is no need to slice anymore when combining
	  SheetViews with UnitViews. Now, a plot_bounding_box is specified,
	  in which the plot is drawn, or the bounds of the Sheet are taken
	  if no plot_bounding_box are specified. There is still some
	  problems for some plot_bounding_box and density values
	  combinations that will have to be adressed, but no current used
	  feature is broken.

	* [r2999] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Made UnitView bounds the same as the source Sheet bounds of the
	  connectionfield; therefore, all SheetViews from a Sheet have the
	  same bounds.

2006-03-27  jbednar

	* [r2998] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed PlotGroupPanel to keep track of the plot_time of the
	  current plot, which may differ from the current simulator time;
	  this makes the back and forward buttons work with all
	  PlotGroupPanels. Cleaned up implementation of back and forward in
	  general.

	* [r2997] examples/tiny.ty:
	  Made it more obvious that the learning_rate is a float

2006-03-27  judelaw

	* [r2996] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added back and forward buttons - only really currently working
	  well for activity window

2006-03-27  jbednar

	* [r2995] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Fixed bug -- if users specified the learning rate as an integer,
	  it was being truncated to an even multiple of the size of the CF,
	  with surprising results. Now effectively promotes the rate to a
	  float.

2006-03-27  ceball

	* [r2994] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Removed print statements accidentally left in the previous
	  version.

	* [r2993] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Altered wording of an error message.

	* [r2992] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Updated documentation for present_input(). Also renamed uses of
	  the 'dest_port' variable name to just 'port' within the
	  ProjectionSheet code; before it was confusing. The Projection has
	  the dest_port and src_port concept (referring to src and dest
	  EPs), but for a ProjectionSheet should it be more like 'in_port'
	  and 'out_port'?

2006-03-27  jbednar

	* [r2991] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added ALERT

	* [r2990] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Improved error message and removed stray unused code

2006-03-27  ceball

	* [r2989] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Removed an outdated HACKALERT.

	* [r2988] topo/base/projection.py:
	  ProjectionSheet raises a TypeError if an attempt is made to
	  connect anything other than a Projection.

2006-03-27  julienciroux

	* [r2987] topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py:
	  Corrected error in previous commit.

2006-03-27  jbednar

	* [r2986] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Better error message; added ALERT

	* [r2985] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Added better checks for whether various plots will be successful
	  for the current simulation

	* [r2984] doc/Future_Work/index_text.php:
	  More work

2006-03-27  ceball

	  initial spatial frequency work

2006-03-27  ceball

	* [r2981] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Set V1 afferents to normalize together. Set afferent connection
	  strengths to have
	  strength 1.

	* [r2980] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added delattr for _sum attribute. Altered commented-out code.

2006-03-25  jbednar

	* [r2979] doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php,
	  doc/Tutorials/lissom_or_text.php:
	  Updated estimates of training times based on an actual run!

	* [r2978] examples/Makefile:
	  Changed to put .typ files in this directory

2006-03-23  jbednar

	* [r2977] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Intermediate checkin; still messy. Added integer scaling option,
	  and sketched eventual cleaned up code for resizing. Turned off
	  sheetcoords by default so that ConnectionField would work

	* [r2976]
	  topo/commands/or_key_white_vert_small.png,
	  topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Changed default size of OR key to be a smaller image

	* [r2975] topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Turned off sheetcoords by default so that ConnectionField would
	  work

2006-03-23  julienciroux

	* [r2974] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Corrected mistype.

	* [r2973] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Corrected the doc.

	* [r2972] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Started an implementation of the scrollbar that is commented out.
	  Deleted unused import statement. Cleaned up doc and comments.
	  Corrected the use of **config by the use of **param in the
	  __init__ method.

2006-03-23  jbednar

	* [r2971] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added alert

	* [r2970] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed actualsize to sheetcoords for clarity; made on by default

	* [r2969] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Renamed Learning iterations to indicate that it's not necessarily
	  learning anything and it's not in terms of iterations (!).
	  Cleaned up time remaining text.

2006-03-22  chrispalmer

	* [r2968] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added actualsize button; name not yet decided

	* [r2967] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added the simulator name to window titles to help users keep
	  multiple simulations straight

2006-03-22  julienciroux

	* [r2966] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Deleted unused attribute self.plots in PlotGroupPanel.Added doc
	  and comment.

2006-03-22  chrispalmer

	* [r2965] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added estimate of time remaining

2006-03-22  julienciroux

	* [r2964] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Changed the argument pgt_name to name for a PlotGroupPanel. There
	  is no references to template in the PlotGroup class.

	* [r2963] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Cleaned up reference to a template from PlotGroupPanel. At the
	  same time, enabled the normalize button for the testpattern. It
	  recquired to re-implement the toggle_normalize in the
	  testpattern, but it is only a temporary solution while
	  re-organizing the panel hierarchy.

2006-03-22  jbednar

	* [r2962] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Fixed bug in recent checking; scheduled events were failing due
	  to lack of a src or dest for which to print information

	* [r2961] Makefile,
	  doc/Makefile:
	  Cleaned up dist package generation

2006-03-22  julienciroux

	* [r2960] topo/base/projection.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testcfsom.py:
	  Deleted the get_in_projection_by_name in ProjectionSheet.
	  Replaced by using the projections() method now that we ensure a
	  unique name for projections to the same ProjectionSheet.

	* [r2959] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Replaced the use of get_in_projection_by_name() by the use of
	  projections(). Now that the problem of having a unique name is
	  solved, we do not need to return a list of projections for a
	  given name. Deeleted correponding Aletrt. Cleaned up the doc.

2006-03-22  jbednar

	* [r2958] Makefile:
	  More files to clean up for distribution

	* [r2957] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Removed completed item

	* [r2956] doc/Downloads/win32_text.php:
	  Added note

	* [r2955] Makefile:
	  First pass at creating dist archive

2006-03-21  julienciroux

	* [r2954] topo/misc/commandline.py,
	  topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py:
	  Removed global constants Pi and PI. The only syntax is now pi.

	* [r2953] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Removed unnecessary exec statements.

	* [r2952] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Removed unnecessary in __main__.__dict__ statements.

2006-03-20  julienciroux

	* [r2951] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Removed the start function and moved the corresponding code
	  within process_argv.

2006-03-18  ceball

	* [r2950] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Corrected DivisiveSumNormalize's test of the current_norm_value.

	* [r2949] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Corrected DivisiveSumNormalize's test of the current_norm_value.

	* [r2948] /trunk/topographica, .cvsignore:
	  Added python_topo directory (which exists on Windows).

	* [r2947] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Started changing to get simulator from topo.sim.

2006-03-18  ceball_cvs2svn

	* [r2946] /tags/CNV_COURSE:
	  This commit was manufactured by cvs2svn to create tag
	  'CNV_COURSE'.

2006-03-18  jbednar

	* [r2945] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Hopefully fixed longstanding issues about minimum and initial
	  plot widths. Plots should now default properly to around 150
	  pixels wide, or larger if the Sheet has more pixels than that.
	  The Reduce button will now allow plots to be reduced down to one
	  pixel per unit, but no further (at the moment)

2006-03-18  ceball

	* [r2944] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Started changing to get simulator from topo.sim.

	  Added debugging messages

	* [r2929] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added alert

	* [r2928] topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/projections/optimized.py,
	  topo/responsefns/optimized.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Removed out-of-date LISSOM_CPointer, CFDotProduct_CPointer,
	  CFProjection_CPointer, and DivisiveHebbian_CPointer; may
	  eventually be resurrected

2006-03-17  jbednar

	* [r2927] examples/cfsom_or.ty:
	  Cleaned up and simplified

	* [r2926] examples/cfsom_or.ty:
	  Changed to Chris's new topo.sim format

	* [r2925] examples/hierarchical.ty:

	* [r2920] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Removed a HACKALERT from SimSingleton.

	* [r2919] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Corrected logic error in SimSingleton.init() that was creating
	  two Simulators (though it left only one behind).

2006-03-17  jbednar

	* [r2918] examples/main.ppm,
	  topo/tests/testcfsom.py:
	  Removed unnecessary image

2006-03-17  ceball

	* [r2917] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Cleaned up code for dictionary-style access to simulator objects.
	  Doing topo.sim['V1']=EP where EP already exists in the simulator
	  results in a warning and the object not being added. Doing
	  topo.sim['V1']=EP2 where topo.sim['V1'] already exists results in
	  the EP already in topo.sim['V1'] being overwritten with EP2 (as
	  for dictionaries). Simulator's _event_processors is now a dict
	  rather than a list to make things simpler.

2006-03-17  jbednar

	* [r2916] doc/User_Manual/time_text.php:
	  Fixed image sizes

2006-03-17  ceball

	* [r2915] examples/hierarchical.ty:
	  Changed to use newer simulator syntax: topo.sim['V1'], etc.

	* [r2914] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  SimSingleton uses the simulator's repr and str methods.

2006-03-17  jbednar

	* [r2913]
	  doc/Developer_Manual/optimization_text.php:
	  Edited Chris's text slightly

	* [r2912] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated my tasks.

	* [r2911] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Reduced SOM radius slightly (and random seeds are different).

	* [r2910] doc/Developer_Manual/index_text.php,
	  doc/Developer_Manual/optimization_text.php:
	  Added some information about how we provide optimized components.
	  It's commented out for the moment so JAB can review it.

2006-03-16  ceball

	* [r2909] examples/som_retinotopy.ty,
	  topo/responsefns/basic.py,
	  topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  CFEuclideanDistance is the basic Python version,
	  CFEuclideanDistance_opt1 is the optimized C version.

	* [r2908] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Removed unused line of imports.

	* [r2907] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  No visible change. Changed commented-out code so it's simpler
	  (still behaves the
	  same).

	* [r2906] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Changed sum property's documentation. Apart from that, no visible
	  change - altered commented-out code.

2006-03-15  ceball

	* [r2905] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Update after recent class changes.

	* [r2904] topo/base/connectionfield.py:

	* [r2902] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Removed unused references to output_fn.

	* [r2901] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  DivisiveSumNormalizeCFOF sets the cfs' sum attribute after
	  normalizing. (Currently has no visible effect.)

	* [r2900] topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Modified documentation.

	* [r2899] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Reverted names of projections - changes which I accidentally left
	  in.

	* [r2898] examples/laminar.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Uses DivisiveSumNormalizeCFOF_opt1 instead of GenericCFOF with
	  single_cf_fn=DivisiveSumNormalize_opt1.

	* [r2897] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Corrected location of single_cf_fn for weight initialization.

	* [r2896] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed output_fn Parameter accidentally left behind in
	  CFLearningFunction.

	* [r2895] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Uses DivisiveSumNormalizeCFOF_opt1 instead of GenericCFOF with
	  single_cf_fn=DivisiveSumNormalize_opt1.

	* [r2894] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Corrected mistake in non-optimized wrapper for
	  DivisiveSumNormalizeCFOF.

	* [r2893] topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  Corrected call to super(), must have been missed from a previous
	  set of commits.

	* [r2892] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Corrected typo (in the code).

	* [r2891] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Uncommented code for DivisiveSumNormalizeCFOF and added
	  non-optimized fallback to
	  GenericCFOF(single_cf_fn=DivisiveSumNormalize).

	* [r2890] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added return statement so all the possible locations aren't
	  opened in open_location().

	* [r2889] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Windows users are unlikely to have the locally built
	  documentation. Therefore, locations on the web are tried if the
	  local copies fail. Also, fixed 'about' text,
	  since the ABOUT_TEXT variable in topo/__init__ had been moved
	  into a function.

	* [r2888] topo/__init__.py:
	  'About' text can be returned or printed. Default is to print, as
	  before.

2006-03-14  ceball

	* [r2887] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Update to a task.

	* [r2886] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  learn() split tp learn() and apply_output_fn(). No visible
	  change. Also committed commented-out code in CFSheet's learn().

	* [r2885] topo/misc/inlinec.py:
	  Reverted to previous version (mistakenly committed).

	* [r2884] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  examples/laminar.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty,
	  examples/som_retinotopy.ty,
	  topo/misc/inlinec.py,
	  topo/responsefns/basic.py,
	  topo/responsefns/optimized.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotgroup.py:
	  Changed response_fns.optimized.CFDotProduct to CFDotProduct_opt1.
	  If inline-optimized components aren't available, falls back to
	  basic's CFDotProduct.

	* [r2883] examples/laminar.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Changed learningfns.optimized.Hebbian to Hebbian_opt1. If
	  inline-optimized components aren't available, falls back to
	  Hebbian.

	* [r2882] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Added 'norm_value' Parameter to OutputFunction(). This is a hack
	  while ConnectionField assumes all OutputFunctions have a
	  norm_value.

	* [r2881] examples/laminar.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  topo/outputfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/tests/testoutputfnsoptimized.py:
	  Changed ouputfns.optimized.DivisiveSumNormalize to
	  DivisiveSumNormalize_opt1. If inline-optimized components aren't
	  available, falls back to DivisiveSumNormalize.

	* [r2880] examples/laminar.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Removed cache_sum attribute from CFProjection.

	* [r2879] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Hebbian sets cf._sum, allowing the sum of the weights to be
	  cached without using the slower Python property.

	* [r2878] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed cache_sum; if _sum attribute exists, it is assumed that
	  the value is always current.

	* [r2877] examples/laminar.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty,
	  topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Split output_fns from learning_fns. Introduced CFOuputFunction
	  class to apply the output_fn to all CFs. Some ways things have
	  been done are a little confusing and could be simplified (notably
	  caching the sum of a CF's weights), but at the moment the example
	  networks should all behave the same.

	* [r2876] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Committed some commented-out classes (the CF output function
	  doesn't belong here).

	* [r2875] examples/homeostatic.ty:
	  Removed apparently unused code.

2006-03-13  ceball

	* [r2874] topo/tests/__init__.py:
	  Test of optimized output functions runs automatically.

	* [r2873] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Added return statements to match other output functions.

	* [r2872] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Corrected DivisiveSumNormalize for when the desired norm_value is
	  not 1.

2006-03-12  ceball

	* [r2871] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Changed DivisiveSumNormalize so that it can accept a
	  pre-calculated norm_value for the array, if one is known. If the
	  pre-calculated value is equal to the current value, no
	  normalization operation need occur.

2006-03-11  ceball

	* [r2870] topo/outputfns/optimized.py:
	  Initial version. DivisiveSumNormalize intended to be equivalent
	  but faster version of that in outputfns/basic.py

	* [r2869] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  The previous commit was a mistake (it was supposed to be
	  outputfns/optimized that I committed, not learningfns/optimized).
	  This is the code from version 1.39.

	* [r2868] topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/tests/testoutputfnsoptimized.py:
	  Initial version. DivisiveSumNormalize intended to be equivalent
	  but faster version of that in outputfns/basic.py

2006-03-10  ceball

	* [r2867] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  DivisiveHebbian's normalization happens every time, whether or
	  not the output activity is zero.

	* [r2866] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added sum of cf's initial weights.

2006-03-09  ceball

	* [r2865] external/mswin/setup.bat,
	  external/mswin/setup.py:
	  Installation creates a desktop shortcut with the Topographica
	  icon.

	* [r2864] external/mswin/create_shortcut.vbs:
	  Creates a desktop shortcut.

2006-03-08  ceball

	* [r2863] external/mswin/setup.py:
	  Fixed typo.

	* [r2862] external/mswin/setup.py:
	  Removed comment left in by accident.

	* [r2861] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Filename arguments are enclosed in repr() so that bits of Windows
	  paths that look like control characters don't turn into control
	  characters. (Note: I don't know that the slashes around the
	  string were for originally.)

	* [r2860] external/mswin/setup.py:
	  Batch file: changes to Topographica path before running, so that
	  the current path variable is correct.

	* [r2859] topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Changed syntax in CFDotProduct: no visible change.

	* [r2858] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Moving to c++ syntax for clarity...no visible change.

	* [r2857] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Moving to c++ syntax for clarity...no visible change.

	* [r2856] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Moving to c++ syntax for clarity...no visible change.

	* [r2855] topo/misc/inlinec.py:
	  Added verbose=0 to the inline() arguments. I'm not sure it
	  actually makes any difference. Developers can set it to 2 to see
	  more output for debugging; 0 should result in less garbage output
	  for users. See the weave documentation (but good luck finding
	  it...try old.scipy.org).

	* [r2854] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Removed apparently redundant try/catch block (there is already
	  one in inlinec.py; in any case, if something other than an
	  ImportError occurs I think a user should see it).

	* [r2853] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Cleanup in DivisiveHebbian - no visible change.

	* [r2852] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Intermediate checkin: DivisiveHebbian has learning in one chunk
	  of C, and normalization in another. No visible change.

	* [r2851] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Intermediate checkin: store sum of cf's weights in cf.sum, and
	  retrieve. No visible change.

	* [r2850] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Intermediate checkin: added sum attribute to connectionfield.

	* [r2849] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Normalization factor is calculated as the sum of the weights each
	  time, rather than accumulating the differences and assuming they
	  summed to 1 in the previous iteration. This has a very small
	  effect; after 20000 iterations, the weights are different in
	  about the 6th decimal place, and a sum over the activity in V1
	  differs in about the fifth decimal place.

2006-03-07  ceball

	* [r2848] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  No visible change: minor change to import statement.

	* [r2847] doc/Downloads/index_text.php:
	  Minor correction to text.

	* [r2846] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated with my current tasks.

	* [r2845] doc/Downloads/index_text.php:
	  Changed Windows installation instructions.

	* [r2844] setup.bat:
	  Just calls external\mswin\setup.bat

	* [r2843] external/mswin/setup.bat,
	  external/mswin/setup.py:
	  Minor changes, plus associates '.ty' files with Topographica.

	* [r2842] external/mswin/setup.bat:
	  Minor change - pauses at the end in case launched by double
	  clicking.

	* [r2841] external/mswin/setup.py:
	  Now generates a script that looks more like the one on unix.
	  Fixed a problem with quotation marks.

	* [r2840] topo/__init__.py:
	  Added 'release' attribute, which is set by the topographica
	  script. Moved ABOUT_TEXT into the about() function so that the
	  release value is filled in once it's been set, rather than
	  before.

	* [r2839] Makefile:
	  Removed setting of TOPORELEASE environment variable, and replaced
	  it by setting topo.release.

	* [r2838] Makefile:
	  Removed PYTHONPATH.

	* [r2837] Makefile:
	  Removed TOPOGRAPHICAPATH.

2006-03-07  jbednar

	* [r2836] external/mswin/setup.py:
	  Hopefully fixes the backslash problem for the generated
	  topographica.py script

2006-03-07  ceball

	* [r2835] topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/projections/optimized.py,
	  topo/responsefns/optimized.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Commented out cpointer code.

2006-03-06  ceball

	* [r2834] external/mswin/setup.py:
	  Corrected another mistake.

	* [r2833] external/mswin/setup.py:
	  Corrected an error with quotation marks.

	* [r2832] external/mswin/setup.bat,
	  external/mswin/setup.py,
	  external/mswin/topographica.bat:
	  Various changes to the scripts.

	* [r2831] Makefile,
	  topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Filename parameter gets the path by going up a level from the
	  directory of the binary, which works on Windows and unix. There
	  might be a better way.

2006-03-06  jbednar

	* [r2830] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Clarified what the snapshot is, to distinguish it from the
	  network snapshot

2006-03-06  ceball

	* [r2829] external/mswin/python242_topo.tar.gz,
	  external/mswin/python242_topo_weave.tar.gz,
	  external/mswin/python_topo.tar.gz:
	  Removed previous versions of Python directories and added one
	  back. The new one has weave and the mingw c compiler, and is
	  configured to use this c compiler by default so it will work on
	  windows without any extra work.

	* [r2828] external/mswin/setup.bat,
	  external/mswin/setup.py,
	  external/mswin/topographica.bat:
	  Updated to work with new python_topo.tar.gz

	* [r2827] Makefile,
	  external/Makefile:
	  Instead of setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable after
	  python has started, we hard-code the lib/ as the path when we
	  make the python binary.

2006-03-04  ceball

	* [r2826] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Added a HACKALERT and corrected a typo in the code.

	* [r2825]
	  external/mswin/python242_topo_weave.tar.gz:
	  Python with weave from scipy. Unfortunately includes other things
	  for the moment that take up space and could be removed.

	* [r2824] external/mswin/setup.bat:
	  Added note on how to get weave.

	* [r2823] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Removed a HACKALERT.

	* [r2822] external/mswin/python242_topo.tar.gz:
	  Python 2.4.2 with Numeric, PIL, matplotlib, Pmw, Fixedpoint

	* [r2821] external/mswin/topographica.bat:
	  Starts python with the topographica.py script. INitial version.

	* [r2820] external/mswin/setup.py:
	  Creates topographica.py script. Initial version.

	* [r2819] external/mswin/setup.bat:
	  Simple windows batch file to install ready-made python. Initial
	  version.

	* [r2818] external/mswin,
	  external/mswin/util,
	  external/mswin/util/gunzip.exe,
	  external/mswin/util/tar.exe:
	  Utilities for extracting archives.

	* [r2817] Makefile,
	  topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Added TOPOGRAPHICAPATH to environment variables.

2006-03-03  ceball

	* [r2816]
	  external/win32/Numeric-24.2.win32-py2.4.exe:
	  New version (added binary)

	* [r2815]
	  external/win32/Numeric-24.2.win32-py2.4.exe:
	  Removed apparently-corrupt file. It wasn't added as binary and
	  isn;t the same size as the original.

	* [r2814] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated my tasks.

	* [r2813] external/win32/python-2.4.2.msi:
	  Added as a binary file.

	* [r2812] external/win32/python-2.4.2.msi:
	  Not in binary format. Two Windows machines I tried it on said it
	  is invalid; it worked on another.

	* [r2811] external/win32/python-2.4.msi:
	  Removed Python 2.4 since it's not used any more (we have 2.4.2).

	* [r2810] Makefile:
	  Topograpgica script: no longer uses os.getenv() - instead
	  accesses the os.environ dictionary itself.

	* [r2809] Makefile:
	  For topographica script: ignore PYTHONPATH environment variable
	  and just use our own Python's path.

2006-03-03  jbednar

	* [r2808] examples/lissom_or_20000.typ:
	  Removed saved .typ files, to speed up CVS downloads

	* [r2807] examples/lissom_oo_or_20000.typ:
	  Removed saved .typ files, to speed up CVS downloads

	* [r2806] doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php,
	  doc/Tutorials/lissom_or_text.php:
	  Changed tututorial instructions to ask users to build a map

	* [r2805] Makefile,
	  examples/Makefile:
	  Added code to generate saved example files

	* [r2804] doc/Future_Work/index_text.php:
	  Added note about filenames as window titles

	* [r2803] ChangeLog.txt:
	  Updated with recent changes

	* [r2802] examples/Makefile:
	  Added one iteration of execution

	* [r2801] Makefile:

	* [r2798] Makefile:
	  Minor cleanup to topographica script

2006-03-02  ceball

	* [r2797] Makefile:
	  Removed 'rm topographica' and put back '> topographica' instead
	  of '>> topographica' on first line. (I didn't realize there was a
	  difference...)

	* [r2796] Makefile:
	  Removed TOPO variable from generated topographica script code.

	* [r2795] Makefile:
	  Changed generated code for topographica script. (1) Environment
	  variables are set before any imports of Topographica things. (2)
	  Environment variables are not set with putenv() (see
	  http://www.python.org/doc/2.4.2/lib/os-procinfo.html). (3)
	  Removed extra slash in first line. (4) Sorted out ':' between
	  paths. (3) and (4) might be wrong and need to be checked.

	* [r2794] topo/__init__.py:
	  No visible change - moved import statemtements to the top.

	* [r2793] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  If topographica is started with no scripts or commands to run, it
	  opens interactively (i.e. './topographica' is the same as
	  './topographica -i').

	* [r2792] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Simplified Filename Parameter, so it has just one search list.

2006-03-02  jbednar

	* [r2791] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Moved an alert here from learningfns/basic.py. (Chris)

	  Removed an irrelevant alert and moved another to
	  patterngenerator. (Chris)

	* [r2789] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Modified commented-out print statement to include simulation
	  time. (Chris)

	* [r2788] Makefile:
	  Added control over test verbosity

	* [r2787] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Fixed scripts to run in main (e.g. to get the value of pi
	  defined); not sure why the previous syntax was not signalling an
	  error

2006-03-02  ceball

	* [r2786] runtests:
	  No longer required: tests can be run like this:\n./topographica
	  -c 'import topo.tests; topo.tests.run()'

	* [r2785] Makefile:
	  Changed how tests are run (no longer uses runtests script).

	* [r2784] topo/tests/__init__.py:
	  Added run() function to allow tests to be run like
	  this:\n./topographica -c 'import topo.tests; topo.tests.run()'

	* [r2783] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Added HACKALERT: think about Parameter class attributes,
	  remembering they won't pickle because Parameter isn't a
	  TopoObject (in most cases that's likely to be fine, but some
	  class attributes are designed to be set by the user). Moved
	  Filename's topographica_path to be an instance attribute for the
	  moment, because trying to set it on unpickling wasn't possible
	  since it's read-only. This will be investigated at the same time
	  as the alert.

	* [r2782] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Removed a line that should have been removed in the previous
	  version.

	* [r2781] topo/base/simulator.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Got rid of some uses of 'active_sim', and got rid of
	  'objects_to_notify_of_active_sim' concept, since the current
	  simulator is always in topo.sim.

2006-03-01  jbednar

	* [r2780] topo/__init__.py:
	  Reduced amount imported

	* [r2779] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Moved aspect_ratio into the default Gaussian neighborhood,
	  because it's conceivable to use a non-unity aspect ratio

	* [r2778] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Fixed bogus assumption that all projections will have a cfs
	  variable, and made it respect the measure_maps declaration. It
	  should now work with lissom_oo_or.ty, but it still needs work
	  because it doesn't seem to measure any useful map for a
	  SharedWeightProjection

	* [r2777] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Clarified help message

	* [r2776] runtests:
	  Added ALERT

	* [r2775] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Added alert

2006-03-01  ceball

	* [r2774] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Removed uses of get_active_sim().

	* [r2773] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Replaced get_active_sim() with topo.sim

	* [r2772] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  No visible change - changed a variable name.

	* [r2771] topo/base/simulator.py,
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testtopoconsole.py:
	  Removed topo.base.simulator.set_active_sim().

	* [r2770] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Just uses topo.sim to get the simulator.

	* [r2769] examples/hierarchical.ty:
	  Added some temporary demonstration lines for how access to the
	  simulator might work.

	* [r2768] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Simulator supports dictionary-like assignment. Temporary method
	  connect2() added to work with this.

	* [r2767] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  On initialization, gets self.simulator from topo.sim. There is
	  always a simulator now. Some plotting menu options need to be
	  updated to check there are sheets of the right type to do
	  whatever it is they're supposed to do.

	* [r2766] topo/__init__.py,
	  topo/base/simulator.py,
	  topo/commands/basic.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added SimSingleton class. Added variable topo.sim=SimSingleton(),
	  so there is simulator (empty) on startup. SimSingleton() keeps
	  one Simulator() object and allows almost-transparent access to
	  it, so topo.sim['V1'] etc is possible. Begun changing calls to
	  get_active_sim etc.

2006-03-01  jbednar

	* [r2765] examples/homeostatic.ty:
	  Initial version for Veldri to work with

2006-02-28  ceball

	* [r2764] runtests:
	  Commented out argument-processing to allow runtests (and 'make
	  all') to work.

	* [r2763] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Uses indepedent streams for input pattern parameters.

	* [r2762] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Made image_path be a parameter; a path can be 'put through' this
	  to ensure it's valid for the OS and that the correct locations
	  are searched.

	* [r2761] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Filename searches prefixes specified for this particular
	  parameter first, then common ones.

	* [r2760] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Filename can be declared with None as the path (i.e. no default
	  path). Changed path searching method, to allow relative and
	  absolute prefix paths.

	* [r2759] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Removed path left in by mistake, updated doc string.

	* [r2758] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/patterns/image.py:
	  For relative paths, Filename now searches both the
	  Filename.common_search_paths list and any specific list of
	  search_paths an instance is given. Currently common_search_paths
	  includes sys.exec_prefix (Topographica base directory.

	* [r2757] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated with current work.

2006-02-28  julienciroux

	* [r2756] Makefile,
	  topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Changed the generate_params and generate_prefixes so that they
	  execute commands as they find them instead of creating a string.
	  They have been re-named exec_argv and exec_prefixes.

2006-02-28  ceball

	* [r2755] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Uses RandomWrapper, so x, y, and orientation are independent
	  random streams, and resume where they left off on pickling.

	* [r2754] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Added RandomWrapper, a modified version of Wrapper, that creates
	  a new Random() instance. Gives independent random streams, and
	  allows the state of the stream to be saved when pickling.

2006-02-28  julienciroux

	* [r2753] Makefile,
	  topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Modified the generate_params and generate_prefixes function in
	  commandline.py so that to work with the first copy of python,
	  instead of having to re-open a new one. Python options are now
	  directly set on the corresponding environment variable, and the
	  string of command is then executed with the exec command. There
	  is one problem for the verbose option: the variable PYTHONVERBOSE
	  is only read during startup, and cannot be re-set afterwards.
	  Therefore, the verbose option is currently disabled.

2006-02-28  jbednar

	* [r2752] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Added alert

2006-02-27  julienciroux

	* [r2751] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Replaced old topographica_script code by the new version that
	  uses Optparse.

	* [r2750] topographica_script.py:
	  Deleted the topographica_script.py file; the code has been moved
	  to topo.misc.commandline.py.

	* [r2749] Makefile:
	  Modified the Makefile to take into account that the code of
	  topographica_script has been moved to topo/misc/commandline.py;
	  also inserted the variable TOPO into the environment. People will
	  have to do a make after the update to get a version that works.

	* [r2748] topo/misc/commandline.py:
	  Moved the topographica_script code to topo/misc/commandline.py.

	* [r2747] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Set the x and y to 0 when creating the Gaussian instead of when
	  calling it. That allows more flexibility for the user.

2006-02-27  ceball

	* [r2746] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Added more helpful error to __getattribute__(), for if a string
	  is not given.

	* [r2745] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Added dictionary-like object access for Simulator: for a
	  Simulator s, s['V1'] does s.objects()['V1'].

2006-02-27  jbednar

	* [r2744] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Fixed typo

	* [r2743] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Minor comment cleanup

	* [r2742] doc/Future_Work,
	  doc/Future_Work/.cvsignore:
	  Added current page

2006-02-26  ceball

	* [r2741] examples/hierarchical.ty:
	  Input pattern parameters set on objects, rather than the class. I
	  use two independent objects here, though for the moment they
	  aren't really independent because everything shares one stream of
	  random numbers.

	* [r2740] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated my tasks.

	* [r2739] examples/laminar.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Input pattern parameters set on a Gaussian object rather than the
	  Gaussian class.

	* [r2738] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  examples/laminar.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty,
	  examples/som_retinotopy.ty,
	  topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Some things will not deepcopy, such as Numeric's ufuncs. Added a
	  Wrapper class (which will be renamed and will probably be changed
	  to operate differently) that allows these things to be
	  deepcopied. CompositePatternGenerator used a ufunc, so is changed
	  to use a Wrapper. Lambdas will also not deepcopy; Wrapper does
	  not support them, but does offer an alternative. Examples files
	  that used lambdas are changed accordingly.

	* [r2737] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  save_snapshot and load_snapshot are changed to include pickling
	  of class attributes.

	* [r2736] topo/misc/utils.py:
	  Added a function (which could be simplified) to search modules
	  and retrieve class' states.

	* [r2735] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  ParameterizedObject has __getstate__() that only returns instance
	  data (before it also returned class data). Also, it deep copies
	  any instance attribute that is a Parameter. Parameter has support
	  for deepcopy and pickle with its own __getstate__ and
	  __setstate__ (required because Parameter uses __slots__, and does
	  not have a __dict__).

2006-02-25  jbednar

	* [r2734] doc/Future_Work/index_text.php:
	  More to do

	* [r2733] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:

	  No visible change: new commented-out code for replacement
	  snapshot functions.

	* [r2730] topo/misc/utils.py:

	  search. Might not belong here.

	* [r2729] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  No visible change: a commented-out Wrapper class.

	* [r2728] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  No visible change: commented-out code for __getstate__() and
	  __setstate__() of Parameter.

	* [r2727] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Updated what I'm working on.

	* [r2726] topo/__init__.py:
	  ABOUT text includes the Topographica release number.

2006-02-24  julienciroux

2006-02-23  julienciroux

	* [r2721] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Corrected to the right density (which has been changed by mistake
	  in the previous commit.

	* [r2720] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Ensured that the neighborhood matrix is defined with x=0 and y=0.

	* [r2719] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Corrected the som_retinotopy example such as not setting x,y and
	  orientation directly on the Gaussian class, but rather creating a
	  Gaussian object and assigning it to the GeneratorSheet.

2006-02-23  ceball

	* [r2718] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added task, moved another to current work section.

	* [r2717] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Projection imported to projections/basic.py so that it's part of
	  the projections package.

	* [r2716] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Projection is an abstract class.

	* [r2715] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Added a task, changed some others round.

2006-02-23  alan_lindsay

	* [r2714] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py:
	  Fixed a wee typo(Ta Chris).

2006-02-23  ceball

	* [r2713] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/utils.py:
	  find_classes_in_package() returns the base class, but does not
	  return any abstract classes.

	* [r2712] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Sheet is declared to be an abstract class.

	* [r2711] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Continued to write Slice class. Added methods sheet2matrix() and
	  matrix2sheet() to Sheet. This is still a work in progress - there
	  won't be so many functions by the end.

	* [r2710] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Tidied up import statements.

2006-02-23  jbednar

	* [r2709] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Changed ParameterizedObject.__repr__ to use __repr__ for
	  attribute values also, to get closer to a valid Python expression

2006-02-23  ceball

	* [r2708] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Corrected html tag error.

	* [r2707] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Removed a task and added another to the doing next section.

	* [r2706] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/base/projection.py:
	  ClassSelectorParameter subclasses have packages attribute that

	* [r2703] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/base/projection.py:
	  ClassSelectorParameter and subclasses use __slots__.

	* [r2702] topo/tkgui/editortools.py:
	  Removed duplicate import statement.

	* [r2701] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Tidying ClassSelectorParameter; no visible change.

2006-02-23  jbednar

	* [r2700] examples/Makefile:
	  Made default LISSOM test be oo_or instead of or to test more code

	* [r2699] doc/Future_Work/current_text.php:
	  Cleaned up and reworded

2006-02-22  ceball

	* [r2698] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  __repr__() returns almost-runnable expression.

	  Removed a task; moved another to currently-working-on section.

	* [r2696] topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/base/simulator.py:
	  No longer overrides __repr__().

	* [r2695] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  ParameterizedObject's __repr__() returns <classname name> and a
	  list of all Parameters. __str__() returns <classname name>.

	* [r2694] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  ClassSelectorParameter's suffix_to_lose defaults to empty string
	  rather than None (which it did before I accidentally changed it).

	* [r2693] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  ClassSelectorParameter doesn't list abstract_classes.

	* [r2692] topo/patterns/random.py:
	  RandomGenerator declared to be an abstract class.

	* [r2691] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Moved topo/base/utils.py to topo/misc/utils.py

	* [r2690] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Classes now have an 'abstract' attribute which is True if the
	  class declares an _abstract_class_name equal to its name and
	  False otherwise (i.e. if it doesn't declare _abstract_class_name,
	  or it's set to False. Abstract classes can be instantiated.

2006-02-22  julienciroux

	* [r2689] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Added the possibility to change the default value for instantiate
	  when creating a ClassSelectorParameter.

	* [r2681] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py,

2006-02-21  jbednar

	* [r2673] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Changed tsettle into a positive Integer parameter instead of a
	  plain attribute

	* [r2672] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Fixed for cases where there are multiple sheets in the model --
	  it had been counting the number of times pre_sleep was called,
	  which happens whenever any input event occurs. Now it counts the
	  number of actual activations for this sheet instead. Should not
	  change the results for lissom_or.ty, but should change the
	  results for lissom_oo_or.ty (which should do one less settling
	  step now)

2006-02-21  ceball

	* [r2671] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Minor alterations to CompositePatternGenerator.

	* [r2670] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Composite is now in a state where it can be tried out usefully in
	  the test pattern window (to see better how it should finally
	  work). But the implementation is temporary.

2006-02-20  ceball

	* [r2669] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Example of how we could prevent instantiation of abstract
	  classes, PatternGenerator in this case. Since the super() call
	  requires the class itself inside the call anyway, putting it in
	  there again is not too much trouble...

	* [r2668] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Change to a HACKALERT.

	* [r2667] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Added to documentation.

2006-02-20  ceball_cvs2svn

	* [r2666] /tags/release_0_8_2:

	  'release_0_8_2'.

2006-02-20  ceball

	* [r2665] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Changed __param_inheritance() to look up the classlist
	  (superclasses) itself, rather than having it passed in. Renamed
	  uses of 'base_classes' to 'superclasses'; previously there was
	  confusion between 'bases' returned from classlist() and bases as
	  passed to the metaclass' __init__() method.

	* [r2664] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  __param_inheritance() changed to look at all slots, not just
	  those in the immediate class (so e.g. a Number parameter does
	  inheritance for bounds,softbounds and all the slots of its
	  superclasses (Parameter in this case)).

	* [r2663] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Moved classlist() and descendents() to beginning of file.

	* [r2619] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Cleaned up doc strings

2006-02-19  julienciroux

	* [r2618] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added a doc string for the learning_fn parameter of a
	  CFProjection.

	* [r2617] topo/projections/optimized.py:
	  Declared the CFProjection_Cpointer learning_fn parameter as a
	  LearningFunctionParameter rather than a Parameter.

	* [r2616] topo/projections/optimized.py:
	  Declared the CFProjection_Cpointer response_fn parameter as a
	  ResponseFunctionParameter rather than a Parameter.

	* [r2615] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added a doc string for the response_fn parameter of a
	  CFProjection.

	* [r2614] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/projection.py,
	  topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Changed the output_fn declared as Parameters to be declared as
	  OutputFunctionParameter. I added a doc string when needed, that
	  might need to be reviewed. I tried to see in which case this doc
	  string was already inherited, and not added it ?\004in such case.

2006-02-19  jbednar

	* [r2613] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  Made BoundingRegionParameter instantiate by default

2006-02-19  julienciroux

	* [r2612] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Deleted the dest_port setting when creating a CFProjection. Now,
	  it is possible for different projections to the same sheet to
	  share the same dest_port (as soon as they are named differently).

	* [r2611] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Solved the problem of the port for Projection: first, ensure that
	  all the projection to the same ProjectionSheet are named
	  differently by raising an error if intenting to do so; second,
	  allow all the projection sharing the same ports to be?\004
	  activated (by removing the break in the activate method).

2006-02-19  jbednar

	* [r2610] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Made bounds be a BoundingRegionParameter, and density be a
	  constant Parameter

2006-02-19  julienciroux

	* [r2609] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Replaced the old bounds.aarect().lbrt() syntax by bounds.lbrt().

2006-02-19  jbednar

	* [r2608] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  Added BoundingRegionParameter

	* [r2607] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Added EventProcessorParameter for src and dest of an EPConnection

	* [r2606] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Added docstring

	* [r2605] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Added ALERT

2006-02-19  julienciroux

	* [r2604] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  Added a lbrt() method to the BoundingBox. It should make Chris
	  happy by allowing him to to do bounds.lbrt().

	* [r2603] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Corrected the Retina edge buffer.

2006-02-19  jbednar

	* [r2602] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Fixed exceptions to be classes

	* [r2601] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  Added Cartesian2DPoint parameter, and changed BoundingCircle to
	  use it and Number instead of Parameter

	* [r2600] ChangeLog.txt:
	  Added new entries

2006-02-18  jbednar

	* [r2599] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Made a few more parameters constant

2006-02-18  julienciroux

	* [r2598] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Corrected a doc referring to topo.base.parameter.

	* [r2597] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Corrected a doc referring to topo.base.parameter.

2006-02-18  alan_lindsay

	* [r2596] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py:
	  Line view bounds check sorted.

	* [r2595] topo/tkgui/editortools.py:
	  Updates class parameters without update button

2006-02-18  ceball

	* [r2594] doc/User_Manual/parameter_text.php:
	  Tried to break text up a little.

	* [r2593] doc/User_Manual/parameter_text.php:
	  Continued writing...

2006-02-18  alan_lindsay

	* [r2592] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editortools.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Added Refresh, Enlarge, Reduce buttons and an error message for
	  when connections don't happen.

2006-02-18  ceball

	* [r2591] doc/User_Manual/parameter_text.php:
	  Continued writing; still incomplete.

2006-02-18  jbednar

	* [r2590] doc/User_Manual/commandline_text.php,
	  doc/User_Manual/images/matrixvectorplot.png,
	  doc/User_Manual/images/sine_plot.png:
	  Added plot screenshots

	* [r2589] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Cleaned up and generalized the documentation. Renamed methods and
	  variables that referred to Topographica, since the classes are
	  now fully general

	* [r2588] doc/Downloads/index_text.php:
	  Added note about make -k

2006-02-18  ceball

	* [r2587] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed get_param_dict() because it simply returns attributes of
	  the TopoObject (and its superclasses) that are Parameters.

	* [r2586] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Tidied comments.

	* [r2585] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Moved two functions to the end of the file.

	* [r2584] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Moved a HACKALERT

	* [r2583] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Parameters with attribute constant==True are set non-editable for
	  an object, and editable for a class (i.e. no visible change, just
	  updated for constant attribute of Parameter).

	* [r2582] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  weights_shape is set to be a constant Parameter.

	* [r2581] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Corrected import for classlist. There might be other files with
	  this mistake?

	* [r2580] topo/base/parameterclasses.py:
	  Removed HACKALERT.

	* [r2579] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Moved Constant to parameterclasses.py

	* [r2578] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Parameters can have a 'constant' attribute. If this is True, they
	  cannot be set on an initialized TopoObject (and they are also
	  instantiated). The Constant Parameter is now simply a Parameter
	  with constant=True. Constant parameters are now no longer
	  excluded from pickling - they are pickled like everything else.
	  Such changes go together because deepcopy uses __getstate__ and
	  __setstate__, as does pickling.

2006-02-17  ceball

	* [r2577] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  All SharedWeightCFProjections were sharing the same
	  cf_slice_and_bounds list because it was declared as a class
	  attribute.

	* [r2576] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Removed print statement accidentally left behind.

	* [r2575] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Corrected mistake in previous commit.

	* [r2574] topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  get_name() doesn't just look in the immediate class for the
	  parameter, but in the whole class hierarchy. Before, None was
	  being returned sometimes. That had broken pickling.

2006-02-17  julienciroux

	* [r2573] topo/base/parameterclasses.py,
	  topo/base/parameterizedobject.py:
	  Moved Parameter (and associated functions class_list() and
	  descendents()) in parameterizedobject.py. I also momentarily
	  moved Constant, until the use of this class in Parameter is
	  deleted (Chris should fix that). Parameter and Constant are?\004
	  still imported in parameterclasses.py, so that we can still
	  import any Parameter class from parameterclasses.py.

2006-02-17  ceball

	* [r2566] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Added HACKALERT.

2006-02-17  julienciroux

	* [r2565] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added comment and ALERT.

2006-02-17  ceball

	* [r2564] topo/base/parameter.py,
	  topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  bounds and softbounds are None when not set so that parameter
	  inheritance works.

2006-02-17  julienciroux

	* [r2563] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/sheets/cfsom.py:
	  Moved the test on the input_buffer from CFSheet learn() to
	  CFProjection learn().

2006-02-17  ceball

	* [r2562] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  set_obj_params() only sets the value on an object if the value is
	  different from the one already in the object.

2006-02-17  jbednar

	* [r2561] topo/sheets/cfsom.py:
	  Moved alert here from som_retinotopy.ty

	* [r2560] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Simplified slightly

2006-02-17  ceball

	* [r2559] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added wrapper around hebbian() so deepcopy works. TopoObject
	  needs to have its support for deepcopy corrected.

	* [r2558] topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  Renamed __set_name() to __generate_name().

	* [r2557] topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  If a Parameter is a TopoObject, and it's deepcopied for a new
	  TopoObject, it's renamed.

	* [r2556] topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  No visible change: created a simple __set_name() method from the
	  original line of code in topoobject. (Done because it will be
	  used when Parameters are deepcopied to new objects.)

	* [r2555] topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  Added HACKALERT about the possibility of TopoObjects sharing the
	  same name.

	* [r2554] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/topoobject.py,
	  topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Added wrapper around mdot so deepcopy works. TopoObject needs to
	  have its support for deepcopy corrected.

	* [r2553] topo/base/arrayutils.py:
	  Added temporary wrapper class around mdot.

2006-02-16  ceball

	* [r2552] topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  Had to add a HACK - some things don't seem to deepcopy.

	* [r2551] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  A Parameter has an 'instantiate' attribute (previously
	  'value_semantics') that indicates whether or not a TopoObject
	  should copy the Parameter into its own __dict__. instantiate
	  defaults to False for Parameter, but True for certain subclasses
	  (e.g. ClassSelectorParameter, Constant).

	* [r2548] examples/laminar.ty:
	  Initial version from Judith

2006-02-15  julienciroux

	* [r2547] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/sheets/cfsom.py:
	  Added a mysterious test (if proj.input_buffer), that I previously
	  deleted in CFSheet abd CFSOM learn() function, but that happens
	  to be needed. This will be solved tomorrow.

	* [r2546] topo/sheets/cfsom.py:
	  Modified the CFSOM learning function so that it calls the learn()
	  function on the projections, instead of re-implementing it.

	* [r2545] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/projection.py:
	  Added a learn() function for Projections, which is called from
	  the CFSheet learn() function.

2006-02-15  ceball

	* [r2544] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_oo_or_20000.typ:
	  Increased ON connection strength to 0.75. C++ LISSOM normalizes
	  all its afferent weights to 1 so the ON and OFF channel can have
	  different effects; topographica doesn't so we compensate by
	  increasing the ON connection strength until we sup?\004port joint
	  normalization.

	* [r2543] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  density and output_fn set on V1 rather than on LISSOM.

	* [r2542] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Various changes to help match c++ lissom (adding edge buffers)
	  and to make the file clearer.

2006-02-14  ceball

	* [r2541] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  min_radius is deleted from the args if it's passed in, so that
	  it's not passed to the superclass. Removed a hackalert.

	* [r2540] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  SharedWeightCFProjection.learning_fn.output_fn set to
	  DivisiveSumNormalize, rather than being set on the Projections
	  separately.

2006-02-14  jbednar

	* [r2539] topo/commands/or_key_white_vert.png:
	  Flipped to fix

2006-02-14  julienciroux

	* [r2538] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added the possibility of passing SheetView plot_template to a
	  ConnectionField PlotGroupTemplate. If the plot_template uses the
	  keyword 'Weights' for the Strength, we request a UnitView,
	  otherwise we create a normal plot with Strength specifying a
	  SheetView. This not at all effective so far, because no such
	  template are declared (also the displaying of labels is not
	  exactly consistent between a connection field plot, and a normal
	  SheetView plot, but still it looks alright).

	* [r2537] topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py:
	  Corrected a typo mistake in the label display.

2006-02-14  ceball

	* [r2536] doc/User_Manual/parameter_text.php:
	  Beginnings of Parameter documentation. Committed while I change
	  locations...

	* [r2535] topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  Added HACKALERT about parameter inheritance.

	* [r2534] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  SharedWeightCFProjection.learning_fn.output_fn set to
	  DivisiveSumNormalize, instead of setting the projections'
	  learning_fn.output_fns separately.

2006-02-14  alan_lindsay

	* [r2533] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Changed the way you change the view of connectioons and sheets.
	  Radius' are represented, though, it seems like connections might
	  not be reporting the truth..

2006-02-13  jbednar

	* [r2532]
	  doc/Tutorials/som_retinotopy_text.php:
	  Minor cleanup

2006-02-13  julienciroux

	* [r2531] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Deleted the added_list attribute and the add() function in
	  PlotGroup. It was an unused concept, and we can still add Plots
	  to a PlotGroup since its plot_list attribute is public.

	* [r2530] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added a function _ordering_plots in PlotGroup. It is called by
	  plots() before returning the plot_list. It allows to only have to
	  re-implement this simple function in ProjectionPlotGroup, instead
	  of the whole plots() function.

2006-02-13  ceball

	* [r2529] doc/User_Manual/space_text.php:
	  Minor changes.

2006-02-13  julienciroux

2006-02-13  ceball

	* [r2527] doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php:
	  Changed Afferent0 that was left over to LGNOnAfferent.

2006-02-13  julienciroux

	* [r2526] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Modified the sorting of the projections in the projection_menu:
	  now they are first sorted with the precedence number of there
	  source Sheet and then by alphabetical order. Also added a comment
	  about re-writing the function _create_projection_dict(), which is
	  quite messy.

	* [r2525] topo/base/sheetview.py:
	  Made the UnitView precedence parameter to be set to the value of
	  the projection.src.precedence parameter (the precedence number of
	  the source Sheet). That allows the plot in the
	  connectionfieldpanel to be sorted accordingly.

2006-02-13  ceball

	* [r2524] examples/lissom_oo_or_20000.typ:
	  Same map, but with updates to code in the pickle.

	* [r2523] topo/base/parameter.py,
	  topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  Parameter has a 'value_semantics' attribute. TopoObject copies
	  the Parameter into its own dictionary if this is set True. This
	  is just a demonstration of how we could do explicit value
	  semantics: setting value_semantics=True on any paramet?\004er
	  means a copy of its default value is always given to a new
	  TopoObject. So for a Constant parameter, setting
	  value_semantics=True makes the Constant truly constant. There is
	  one example of this for demonstration: Sheet's bounds. Presumably
	  the attribut?\004e shouldn't actually be called value_semantics.

2006-02-13  jbednar

	* [r2522] doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php:

2006-02-13  ceball

	* [r2520] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Updated to take account of patterngenerator being passed the true

	* [r2487] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Changed the sort_plots function (and introduced a new cmp_plot
	  function) to sort according to bith the precedence and the
	  alphabetical order.

	* [r2486] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Forgotten CFSheet precedence default value in previous commit.

	* [r2485] topo/plotting/plot.py:

	  same time as the src_name).

	* [r2484] topo/analysis/featuremap.py,

	* [r2463] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Allows class constants to be set, crudely. A dictionary of

	  the editor sheet.

	* [r2461] topo/base/utils.py:

	* [r2453] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Positioned network for model editor. Replaced lambda functions
	  for getting random.uniform value with a class (to allow
	  pickling); this class will be moved.

	* [r2452] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  LGN declared with measure_maps=False.

	* [r2451] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Sheets with a measure_maps attribute, and with it set True, get
	  their maps measured - others do not.

	* [r2450] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added a 'measure_maps' attribute to CFSheet.

	* [r2449] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  No longer have afferent_weight_bounds, lgn_weight_bounds, and
	  input_bounds. Instead, bounds are just created by
	  radial_bounds().

2006-02-10  jbednar

	* [r2448] doc/User_Manual/space_text.php:
	  Minor clarification

2006-02-10  ceball

	* [r2447] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Eliminated inhibitory_ and excitatory_weight_bounds variables,
	  instead just creating the bounds where the projection is defined.

	* [r2446] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty,
	  topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Renamed wt_bounds() to radial_bounds().

	* [r2445] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Gaussian class' parameters are not now set; instead, parameters
	  on the Retina's input_generator are set.

	* [r2444] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Added a hack to allow DynamicNumbers to work when they are set on
	  an object.

	* [r2443] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Hacked the hack in load_snapshot to allow
	  examples/lissom_oo_or_20000.typ to keep its dynamic input pattern
	  numbers. Because the unpickleable lambda functions for generating
	  random numbers are used in two different ways now, there are two
	  different hacks here. Once we eliminate those lambda functions,
	  it should all be ok.

	* [r2437] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Added the color_key to the Orientation Preference
	  PlotGroupTemplate.

	* [r2436] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed the function load_image; now, all topographica plot are
	  resized to be the close as possible to the height of the biggest
	  topographica plot; then, the static_images are resized to be of
	  this height. There is still a warning about using the
	  image.resize function with floats that we need to take care
	  about.

	* [r2435] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Set the resize parameter to False when creating static image
	  plot.

	* [r2434] topo/plotting/bitmap.py:
	  Added a resize attribute for a bitmap; it is set to True by
	  default. It is a flag that allows distinguishing between
	  topographica plot and static external images when resizing them.

	* [r2433] doc/images/color_key.png:
	  Added the color_key png file in doc/images.

2006-02-09  ceball

	* [r2432] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Corrected setting LGN's density - I probably re-introduced
	  accidentally setting it on the CFSheet class.

	* [r2431] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Removed bounds change that has no effect at this density. Updated
	  learning rates.

	* [r2430] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Updated parameters to match the ones in
	  lissom_oo_or_reference.ty. There are more to go...

	* [r2429] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Simplified weights bounds specification with wt_bounds().

	* [r2428] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Removed last change_bounds for lateral excitatory connection
	  because it wouldn't occur anyway for this density.

	* [r2427] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Added note to myself.

	* [r2426] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Added a HACAKLERT about missing scheduled events.

	* [r2425] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Use wt_bounds() function to set weight bounds. Included
	  min_exc_rad parameter.

	* [r2424] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed print statement accidentally left in previous commit.

	* [r2423] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added wt_bounds(), which allows a bounding box to be created with
	  simple syntax from a radius. Also allows specification of a
	  minimum radius. Added a HACKALERT about the change_bounds
	  warning.

	* [r2422] topo/tests/oo_or_map_topo.log:
	  About 20000 iterations from the equivalent c++ lissom simulation.

	* [r2421] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  Learning rates set on correct projections.

	* [r2416] topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty:
	  LGNOn and LGNOff to V1 connection strengths halved. LGNOn and
	  LGNOff sheet bounds adjusted. (Chris)

2006-02-08  julienciroux

	* [r2415] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added a function _add_static_images() in TemplatePlotGroup. It
	  creates the Plot specified by the static_images attribute of the
	  PlotGroupTemplate, and add them to the added_list of Plot (This
	  will still need some clean up).

	* [r2414] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Added an attribute static_images to the PlotGroupTemplate and a
	  method add_static_image; static_images is a KeyedList of tuple
	  (name,file_path) specifying a Plot from an image file. It will
	  enable specifying additional static plots to a
	  Pl?\004otGroupTemplate (e.g. color key for Orientation
	  Preference). There is no images added to a template yet, because
	  the re-sizing needs to be fixed in PlotGroupPanel; therefore, the
	  line is commented out for the moment.

	* [r2413] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Added a missing import statement; added a call to the super class
	  in the Plot __init__.

	* [r2412] topo/plotting/bitmap.py,
	  topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Deleted the unuseful FileBitmap class.

	* [r2411] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testplot.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Renamed make_plot() to make_template_plot().

	* [r2410] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Changed the Plot hierarchy: now the Plot class is really simple
	  and just creates its bitmap from an image; the former Plot class
	  has been renamed TemplatePlot, and others sub-classes inherit
	  from it. It remains to re-name the make_plot fun?\004ction to
	  make_template_plot. Also deleted the BitmapPlot class which is
	  now replaced by the simple Plot class.

2006-02-07  julienciroux

	* [r2399] topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Simplified version of CFDotProduct().It still needs some clean up
	  (e.g using C++ syntax). It seems to perform a bit better than the
	  previous optimized version; in any case it does not do worse
	  (most of the times, the profiling statistics are better for the

	  No visible change. Committed commented-out code for circular

	* [r2396] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Undid previous changes. I didn't notice that in c++ lissom the
	  changes to e.g. exc_radius were accumulating.

	* [r2395] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Altered to match equivalent c++ lissom simulation: scheduled
	  lateral excitatory bounds changes, scheduled lateral excitatory
	  learning rates, scheduled afferent learning rates.

	* [r2394] topo/tests/or_map_topo.log:
	  20001 iterations from c++ lissom's or_map_topo.param

	* [r2393] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:

	  commits).

	* [r2384] topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Removed the variables or and oc (that were having no effect and
	  should have been removed in the previous version).

	* [r2383] topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Removed an apparently problematicoptimization from CFProjection,
	  but it needs to be done properly. Julien is going to do this, and

	* [r2363] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Allows the current value to belong to a class that is not one of
	  the usual classes for a given parameter. This allows
	  CFProjections to be manipulated.

	* [r2362] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Seems to allow updating of connections and sheets and selected
	  classes within fields of these.

	* [r2361] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Allows a dictionary, with a list entry for fields of the object,
	  to be passed in; these lists are searched for object covers for
	  each of the possible classes of a class selector item. Works for
	  sheets.

2006-02-05  ceball

	* [r2360] topo/tests/or_map_topo.log:
	  About 200 iterations from current c++ reference.

	* [r2359] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Use only integer part of rf_radius, as c++ LISSOM does.

	* [r2358] topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  Added missing import statement.

2006-02-04  alan_lindsay

	* [r2357] topo/base/utils.py:
	  a method that takes a dictionary and a key and returns
	  dictionary[key] or key if it doesn't exist.

	* [r2356] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  First attempt at allowing a translator dictionary to be passed to
	  parameter frame, has broken embedded class property windows
	  though.

	* [r2355] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Displays activity as soon as you set it. Does not need refreshed
	  anymore.

	* [r2354] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Class selector fields can have there properties modified. These
	  are lost as soon as the original object is updated. Works for
	  TestPatterns.

2006-02-03  jbednar

	* [r2353]
	  doc/Tutorials/som_retinotopy_text.php:
	  Fixed paths

	  Clarified issue found by Yoonsuck

2006-02-03  chrispalmer

	* [r2345] topo/tests/tkgui/__init__.py,
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Corrected a strange bug in testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py. The
	  'case' notation was not working there.. maybe because the
	  tests/tkgui/ directory is a sub-directory?

2006-02-03  ceball

	* [r2344] topo/tests/tkgui/__init__.py:
	  Commented out import of test that doesn't seem to run properly.
	  It's not clear why it doesn't run.

	* [r2334] topo/tests/or_map_topo.log:
	  Updated for changes to c++ lissom's params file.

	* [r2333] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Changed rf_radius, inh_rad, and exc_rad. Changed
	  retina_edge_buffer and RN. Altered layout at start of file to
	  look more like equivalent c++ lissom params file. The input
	  pattern is identical to C++ lissom, but the activity in V1 has
	  not y?\004et been matched (the parameters aren't all being used
	  correctly).

2006-02-03  jbednar

2006-02-02  julienciroux

	* [r2328] examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty:
	  Corrected the initial and final learning rate value, according to
	  the new changes in learning rate computation in HebbianSOMLF().

	* [r2327] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Fixed sort_plot() according to the new changes in Plot. Cleaned

	  Renamed BasicPlotGroupPanel to TemplatePlotGroupPanel.

2006-02-01  alan_lindsay

	* [r2309] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Tidied and some of the methods written a little nicer.

2006-02-01  julienciroux

	* [r2308] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Renamed UnitWeightsPlotGroup to ConnectionFieldsPlotGroup, for
	  consistency with the template name. Nevertheless, I realised that
	  it might be confusing from a developper point of view: the
	  concept of CF is different that the weights of a unit, i.e. we
	  can have sheets with no CF and still vizualize the weights of a
	  unit.

	* [r2307] topo/plotting/templates.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Renamed the Connection Field template to Connection Fields
	  (plural).

	* [r2306] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Deleted two old ALERTS and wrote a new one.

	* [r2305] topo/plotting/bitmap.py,
	  topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Replaced the Bitmap's view_info attribute by a name and
	  plot_src_name attributes; they are copies of the plot's
	  attributes of the same name. Now, the string that has to be
	  displayed is built from these two attributes in PlotGroupPanel's
	  display_labels(). The UnitWeightPanel() display_labels method has
	  to be modified: connection fields panel and projection's panel do
	  not handle labels as a normal BasicPlotGroupPanel.

2006-02-01  ceball

	* [r2304] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Changed V1's density to 48. Changed CFSheet's density to 24.
	  Connected on and off LGN sheets to V1, though not properly.

	* [r2303] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  If a unit is near the sheet edge, the shared weights matrix will
	  not necessarily be the right matrix - the correct submatrix is
	  needed. Added code to do that.

	* [r2302] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Changed the function that was for slicing the mask matrix to one
	  that returns the slice.

2006-02-01  julienciroux

	* [r2301] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Replaced the Plot attribute view_info (a dict) by a single
	  plot_src_name. It has still to be changed in future commit.

	* [r2300] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/sheetview.py,
	  topo/commands/analysis.py,
	  topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/projections/basic.py,
	  topo/tests/testplot.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheet.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheetview.py:
	  Deleted the attribute view_info of a SheetView, replaced by a
	  single src_name attribute. Deleted the parameter view_type that
	  wasn't of any use. Also added two ALERT in sheetview.py that will
	  have to be examined.

2006-02-01  ceball

	* [r2299] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Added performance profiling code examples back in (they're
	  commented out).

2006-02-01  julienciroux

	* [r2298] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/hierarchical.ty:
	  Corrected the learning rate now that the HebbianSOMLF function
	  does not use the constant_sum_connection_rate() anymore.

	* [r2297] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Adapted the min radius to be set like in the book (0.5/40 in
	  sheet coordinates), now that there is a crop_radius. It gives a
	  good result (with the same parameters than in the book: 40 units
	  and so on...), but I did not compared it with our previous result
	  with a radius of 1.25/40.

	* [r2296] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Made the simulation use the new C coded CFEuclideanDistance()
	  function; also corrected the generator sheet density to be 24 (it
	  has been committed with a value of 40, by mistake). Also got rid
	  of unused commented out code.

	* [r2295] topo/responsefns/optimized.py:
	  C version of the CFEuclideanDistance reponse function. It is
	  mostly based on the C version of CFDotProduct().It does seem to
	  be about 1.5 times faster (when it took 1mn it now takes 40s). It
	  could probably be even faster (as well as the CFDotProduct() C
	  version, I think) but would need more work.

2006-01-31  julienciroux

	* [r2294] topo/plotting/palette.py:
	  Started an implementation of the String-Based Palette class. It
	  is just committed for my convenience, but there is nothing
	  finished at all; it shouldn't affect anything to commit it
	  though.

	* [r2293] examples/som_retinotopy.ty,
	  topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Fixed afferent learning rate scaling for SOMs; i.e, don't need
	  scaling at all for this learning function. Changed the
	  crop_radius for the neighborhood function to have a minimum
	  radius, to ensure that it covers at least a neighboring unit in
	  each direction

2006-01-31  ceball

	* [r2292] examples/lissom_oo_or.ty:
	  Initial version - incomplete. Based on lissom_or.ty, but with
	  circular connectionfields.

	* [r2291] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Updated SharedWeightCFProjection to match changes in
	  connectionfield and cfprojection. Not yet tested.

	* [r2290] topo/tests/or_map_topo.log:
	  20009 iterations from c++ lissom.

	* [r2289] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Updated learning rates to correct ones from lissom_or.ty before
	  it was split into lissom_or.ty and lissom_or_reference.ty. THey
	  were lost when lissom_or_reference was reverted to 21st December
	  2005 code.

2006-01-30  ceball

	* [r2288] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Back to the previous network size (BaseN=72).

	* [r2287] topo/tests/or_map_topo.log:
	  200 iterations from c++ lissom

	* [r2286] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Using a smaller network.

	* [r2285] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Altered some hackalerts.

	* [r2284] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Mask centered on matrixidx center.

	* [r2283] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Added hack to remove Random Generator from the list of
	  PatternGenerators in the test pattern window. But it will still
	  appear in other menus.

2006-01-30  jbednar

	* [r2282] ChangeLog:
	  Updated with recent changes

2006-01-30  julienciroux

	* [r2281] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Renamed the single_connection_learning_rate() to
	  constant_sum_connection_rate(); it indicates that the learning
	  rate is scaled based on keeping the sum constant,which leaving it
	  open for adding other types of connection_rate() functions.

	* [r2280] topo/analysis/featuremap.py,
	  topo/plotting/bitmap.py:
	  Modified featuremap so that in the case of a cyclic value the
	  preference matrix is normalized, but not in the case of a
	  non-cyclic value. It solves the problem of the position
	  preference plot shrinking when increasing the range of values.
	  Though it might be an alright reasoning, an hack alert has been
	  added in FeatureMap and in bitmap.py, because it made me realised
	  that if this normalization is not performed for a sheetview that
	  will be used as the hue key in an HSV plot, an error will occur
	  in bitmap. Therefore, we should think about this case, and decide
	  what to do to avoid unexpected errors in the future.

	* [r2279] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Corrected a mistyped parenthesis.

2006-01-30  ceball

	* [r2278] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Mask is resized by change_bounds() in a way that is consistent
	  with how it's generated in the first place. Not sure if it's the
	  right way though - these changes have not yet been verified (but
	  the resizing is better than before, in any cas?\004e).

	* [r2277] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  ConnectionField.__init__()'s mask creation code is moved to a
	  subroutine.

	* [r2276] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Moved CFProjection's mask creation code to a subroutine.

	* [r2275] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  weight_type no longer an attribute of CFProjection (and no longer
	  passed to ConnectionField). Instead, it's a global variable.

	* [r2274] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Corrected variable name error in previous commit. Updated a
	  HACKALERT.

	* [r2273] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Changed to circular ConnectionFields.

	* [r2272] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Mask pattern is generated in CFProjection and passed to each
	  ConnectionField. A ConnectionField takes the correct submatrix of
	  this mask (which is all of the mask, unless it is near an edge.
	  The way this is done needs to be simplified, but?\004 is
	  currently working. The size calculated for a mask that is e.g. a
	  Disk does not appear to be correct.

2006-01-30  jbednar

	* [r2271] topo/patterns/random.py:
	  Made RandomGenerator base class to make it simpler to add other
	  Random classes. Added GaussianRandom

2006-01-29  jbednar

	* [r2270] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Cleaned up comments

	* [r2269] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Changed density to match lissombook

	* [r2268] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Changed crop_radius_multiplier to match fm2d; will make
	  simulations much slower but much more likely to work. Also added
	  commented-out print function printing parameters in the format of
	  fm2d

	* [r2267] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Added radius_crop_multiplier. Shouldn't have changed the behavior
	  at all yet.

2006-01-29  ceball

	* [r2266] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Corrected mistake in previous version.

	* [r2265] examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Masks are setup with the size of the weights_bounds_template.
	  This is an intermediate checkin for how it will work, but the
	  specification of the weights_shape at the user level code won't
	  change. hierarchical contains a commented-out example.

2006-01-29  jbednar

	* [r2264] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Cleaned up comments and documentation

	* [r2263] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Fixed to match recent change in definition of Gaussian
	  PatternGenerator size

	* [r2262] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Added CoG plot

	* [r2261] topo/commands/lineplotting.py:
	  Added user-controllable sheet_view names for x and y preferences
	  in topographic_grid. Suppressed annoying plotting display glitch.

	* [r2260] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Added measure_cog function. Added user-controllable x_range and
	  y_range parameters to measure_position_pref.

	* [r2259] topo/base/arrayutils.py:
	  Added centroid function written by Julien

	* [r2258] topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  Improved CFEuclideanDistance_Py

	* [r2257] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added alert

2006-01-29  ceball

	* [r2256] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  initialize_slice_array() changed to initialize_bounds().
	  initialize_bounds() takes the centered bounds, converts them to a
	  slice at the origin of the sheet, then translates that slice to
	  the cf's location, and finally stores the correspond?\004ing
	  bounding box (and slice_array for access by C). Removed
	  set_slice_array().

	* [r2255] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Removed a CEBHACKALERT, which was out of date.

2006-01-29  jbednar

	* [r2254] topo/misc/patternfns.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Changed name of height and width for gaussian and gabor to xsigma
	  and ysigma, to avoid confusion (since they are radii and not
	  actual widths and heights)

	* [r2253] doc/Reference_Manual/index_text.php:
	  Minor updates

2006-01-29  julienciroux

	* [r2252] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Added a class TemplateFile to plotfilesaver. It is just a first
	  try for implementing plotfilesaver. Just committed for my
	  convenience (i.e. beeing able to work on it at the office.)

2006-01-28  ceball

	* [r2251] doc/Downloads/win32_text.php:
	  Corrected scipy install command.

2006-01-28  julienciroux

	* [r2250] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Renamed BasicPlotGroup to TemplatePlotGroup.

	* [r2249] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Changed the default size value for the Gaussian to be 0.5 (to
	  match recent changes in Gaussian size definition).

	* [r2248] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Changed the hierarchy of the PlotGroup classes: now PlotGroup is
	  a simpler class that works by passing it a plot_list of plots,
	  while BasicPlotGroup (soon to be renamed TemplatePlotGroup)
	  implements the generation of the plot_list according to a
	  template specification; others PlotGroup classes now inherit from
	  BasicPlotGroup.

	* [r2247] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty,
	  examples/som_retinotopy.ty,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py,
	  topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty,
	  topo/tests/testlissom.ty,
	  topo/tests/testlissom_cpointer.ty:
	  Modified the size parameter for a Gaussian so that it corresponds
	  to the real size (and it is consistent with the definition of the
	  size for,e.g. a disk or rectangle). The width of the Gaussian
	  (sigma) corresponds to half the size.

	* [r2246] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Updated doc for slice2bounds().

	* [r2245] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Added some commentary; working version for switching from
	  CFDotProduct to CFEuclideanDistance_Py response function. Left
	  with a density of 10, used during testing.

	* [r2244] topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  First version of an euclidean-distance response function. This is
	  supposed to be used by the som_retinotopy example, but did not
	  allow to achieve the expected result yet.

2006-01-28  ceball

	* [r2243] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed line left in by mistake in the previous commit.

2006-01-28  jdepaula

	* [r2242] doc/Downloads/index_text.php:
	  Changed line about Windows install to use CVS

	* [r2241] doc/Downloads/win32_text.php:
	  added that scipy_core is already in external

2006-01-28  ceball

	* [r2240] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Restored situate, but haven't checked it's correct.

	* [r2239] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added initial version of Slice object; currently unused and
	  untested.

	* [r2238] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Simplified a little - nobody would be passing in pattern_x and
	  pattern_y as parameters.

	* [r2237] topo/base/parameter.py,
	  topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  A TopoObject is 'uninitialized' until its __init__() method
	  completes. A Constant Parameter can be set on an uninitialized
	  TopoObject.

2006-01-27  ceball

	* [r2236] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  slice2matrixshape() removed and replaced with current functions
	  from sheet (bounds2slice() with crop_slice_to_sheet_bounds),

	* [r2235] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/patterns/image.py,
	  topo/patterns/random.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  PatternGenerator no longer takes slice_array from
	  ConnectionField. Now, it is passed the ConnectionField's bounds
	  and x and y location. PatternGenerator still evaluates the
	  pattern in the center rather than at the ConnectionField's
	  location. bounds2slice()-type functions are tidied up a bit in
	  sheet. lissom_or_reference behavior is unchanged.

	* [r2234] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Updated to current Topographica code (had been setup for
	  2005/12/21 code). Actual tests commented out.

	* [r2233] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Accidentally checked in a half-finished version previously.

	* [r2232] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Changed to work with different functions in sheet.py. The changes
	  will probably need updating after work on sheet.py is finished.

	* [r2231] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/sheet.py:
	  No visible changes. Removed bounds2shape(). Temporary
	  modification to bounds2slice() allowing it to skip cropping the
	  slice to the sheet. Temporarily added slice2matrixshape().
	  ConnectionField temporarily modified so its behavior is
	  unchanged.

	* [r2230] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Removed use of bounds2shape() function. Image is now broken, but
	  does not cause errors. To be fixed after modification of sheet.py
	  is finished.

	* [r2229] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Commented-out bounds2shape() tests. They will be replaced with an
	  equivalent test.

	* [r2228] topo/tests/testlissom.ty:
	  CFDotProduct moved to topo/responsefns/optimized.py

2006-01-27  jbednar

	* [r2227] doc/Downloads/win32_text.php:
	  Added Id tag

	* [r2226] doc/Downloads/win32_text.php:
	  Minor updates

2006-01-26  ceball

	* [r2225] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Removed an import that was preventing the tests from running.

	* [r2224] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Temporary hack (I'm sorry) in bounds2shape() to get round a
	  problem (which only occurs for some bounds and densities) in
	  bounds2slice() - I think it's a floating point issue.

2006-01-26  jdepaula

	* [r2223] doc/Downloads/win32_text.php:
	  Extensive revision to directions, turned into steps, and Weave is
	  now more of a natural part of the installation process.

2006-01-26  ceball

	* [r2222] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Added a test that involves the kind of situation that exists in
	  creating a connection field. The test fails because
	  bounds2shape() returns the wrong shape. Is the problem a floating
	  point issue?

2006-01-26  alan_lindsay

	* [r2221] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Activity of a sheet can be displayed in the Editor, upsidedown..

2006-01-26  jbednar

	* [r2220] topo/commands/lineplotting.py:
	  Added ALERT

	* [r2219] examples/lissom_or_20000.typ:
	  This version was self-organized again, instead of just editing
	  the file to change the path (though that seemed to work fine)

	* [r2218] examples/lissom_or_20000.typ:
	  Moved inlinec-dependent functions from responsefns/basic.py to
	  responsefns/optimized.py

2006-01-26  julienciroux

	* [r2217] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Added doc for _normalize() and _situate_plot().

	* [r2216] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Corrected normalize again: in case of a negative or zero
	  constant, a zero matrix is returned; in case of a positive value,
	  a one matrix is returned.

2006-01-26  jbednar

	* [r2215] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Fixed docstring

2006-01-26  julienciroux

	* [r2214] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Corrected _normalize() so that it returns a one matrix in case of
	  a constant.

2006-01-26  jbednar

	* [r2213] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty,
	  examples/som_retinotopy.ty,
	  topo/projections/optimized.py,
	  topo/responsefns/basic.py,
	  topo/responsefns/optimized.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotgroup.py:
	  Moved inlinec-dependent functions from basic.py to optimized.py

	* [r2212] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Minor documentation cleanup

2006-01-25  jbednar

	* [r2211] ChangeLog:
	  Updated with recent changes

	* [r2210] topo/commands/lineplotting.py:
	  Enforced minimum size of topographic map plots

2006-01-25  julienciroux

	* [r2209] topo/commands/analysis.py,
	  topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Changed the name of the template CoG Preference to be Position
	  Preference. Also changed measure_cog() to be named
	  measure_position_pref().

2006-01-25  jbednar

	* [r2208] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Added question about proper scaling for a SOM learning rate

	* [r2207] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Added tsettle alert

	* [r2206] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Changed all parameter files to remove initial iteration so that
	  the user can inspect an untrained network

	* [r2205] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Added alert

	* [r2204] doc/shared/util.php:
	  Minor tweak

2006-01-25  ceball

	* [r2203] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  bounds2shape() uses bounds2slice() to get the matrix shape.

	* [r2202] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/patterns/random.py:
	  PatternGenerator no longer uses bounds2shape(); instead, it uses
	  bounds2slice(). If the slice is already known, it can be passed
	  in (as an optimization, like rows and cols could be passed in
	  before). There should be no visible changes.

2006-01-25  julienciroux

	* [r2201] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Corrected an error in last commit.

	* [r2200] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Version that appears to match the parameter in the book, but
	  still does not give the expected results with Topographica.

	* [r2199] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Improved the code in PatternPresenter: now use the __setattr__
	  method rather than an exec to update the pattern generator
	  attributes.

	* [r2198] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Adjusted the parameters to match the simulation in the book.

	* [r2197] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Minor cleaning.

2006-01-24  jdepaula

	* [r2196] doc/Downloads/index_text.php,
	  doc/Downloads/win32_text.php:
	  Updated documentation for Windows port

2006-01-24  julienciroux

	* [r2195] topo/plotting/__init__.py:
	  Deleted plotengine from the plotting/__init__.py file.

	* [r2194] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Cleaned up old alerts.

	* [r2193] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Cleaned up comments and old alerts.

2006-01-24  jdepaula

	* [r2192] external/win32/setup.py:
	  Added header information about the different steps within
	  setup.py

	* [r2191] external/win32/README.txt:
	  Moved what the code in setup.py does, into setup.py

2006-01-24  julienciroux

	  Deleted the parameter plotgroup_type and plotgroup_key when
	  creating a PlotGroupPanel.

2006-01-24  jdepaula

	* [r2189] topo/misc/inlinec.py,
	  topographica_script.py:
	  Changed direction of importing. Lowercased variable.

2006-01-24  julienciroux

	* [r2188] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Re-organized import statements.

	* [r2187] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Added the normalizing for the RGBPlot.

	* [r2186] topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py:
	  Got rid of unused default value.

	* [r2185] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Deleted the normalize field in the plot_templates. Now, normalize
	  is only specified for a PlotGroupTemplate.

	* [r2184] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Added a parameter normalize to be passed to a PlotGroup. Now the
	  information normalize is no longer passed through the template
	  but rather by modifying the PlotGroup.normalize attribute.

2006-01-24  ceball

	* [r2183] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  bounds2slice() always returns int values.

2006-01-24  julienciroux

	* [r2182] topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Renamed the PlotGroupPanel attribute plot_group to
	  plot_group_title.

	* [r2181] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Started a re-organization of the file. Moved code around to made
	  it clearer. Added alert about how to improve the file, and take
	  the normalize information from the template rather than the first
	  plot_template. (This has been tested with version 1.42 of
	  sheet.py because the new version 1.43 has introduced an error in
	  the slicing of the sheetviews.)

2006-01-24  ceball

	* [r2180] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  bounds2slice() returns the slice that includes all units whose
	  centres are within the specified bounds (and within the sheet's
	  bounds).

2006-01-24  julienciroux

	* [r2179] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/plotting/templates.py,

	  Got rid of the now un-used Density and Projection_name fields in
	  the Projection PlotGroupTemplate.

	* [r2178] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Omitted in previous commit: changed the name of update_weights()
	  to update_connectionfields().

	* [r2177] topo/plotting/templates.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Renamed the Unit Weights template to Connection Field; made the
	  corresponding change in topoconsole. Also modified the way labels
	  is display from the UnitWeightsPanel to display the name of the
	  template (as it is defined in templates.py). I think we might
	  renamed UnitWeightsPanel to ConnectionFieldPanel, it has to be
	  decided.

	* [r2176] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Added a function new_plotgroup_template to create and store a
	  PlotGroupTemplate. Renamed add_plot_template() to add_plot(), and
	  re-write all the template creation using new_plotgroup_template()
	  and add_plot().

2006-01-23  ceball

	* [r2175] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Added a note about the input_bounds.

2006-01-23  julienciroux

	* [r2174] examples/cfsom_or.ty:
	  Added a comment to explain how to find the learning rate.

	* [r2173] examples/som_retinotopy.ty:
	  Added the skeleton for the retinotopic map simulation. It has to
	  be modifiedf
	  so that the parameters exactly match the simulation published in
	  the book.

2006-01-23  alan_lindsay

	* [r2172] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py:
	  1st receptive field in centre and labels are closer to middle.

2006-01-23  ceball

	* [r2171] topo/tests/testlissom.ty:
	  Added test for activity matrix size.

	* [r2170] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  No visible change for networks that use weight generators like
	  COnstat() or UniformRandom(): weights patterns drawn at the
	  center of the sheet rather than at the ConnectionField's x and y
	  location (as used to be the case).

	* [r2169] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  No visible change. Removed redundant 'maxrow+1', clarified
	  'toprow+1'. Cleaned up docstring.

	* [r2168] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  No visible change. Altered variable names in bounds2slice().

2006-01-22  jbednar

	* [r2167] examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty:
	  Made initial state be clean

	* [r2166] topo/commands/lineplotting.py:
	  Minor tweaks

	* [r2165] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Removed temporary plot_cog() command

	* [r2164] topo/commands/lineplotting.py,
	  topo/plotting/templates.py,
	  topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added topographic_grid plot

	* [r2163] topo/commands/analysis.py:
	  Temporary commit to preserve octave-based topographic-grid
	  plotting; requires external command topogrid in ./external/

	* [r2162] topo/analysis/updatecommands.py,
	  topo/commands/analysis.py,
	  topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Moved topo/analysis/updatecommands to topo/commands/analysis

	* [r2161]
	  doc/Developer_Manual/imports_text.php:
	  Minor tweak

	* [r2160] topo/base/arrayutils.py:
	  Added octave_str and octave_output commands

	* [r2159] doc/Future_Work/index_text.php:
	  Added link to pymat

	* [r2158] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Added a few notes

2006-01-20  julienciroux

	* [r2157] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added a comment about a JABALERT./topographica -g
	  examples/cfsom_or.ty I need Jim's advise before getting rid of
	  it.

	* [r2156] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Wrote an add_plot_template() function in PlotGroupTemplate in
	  order to create them more conveniently. I did not change the
	  current way templates are defined because I am waiting for Jim
	  reviewing the function and confirming it is OK.

	* [r2155] topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheet.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheetview.py,
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testactivitypanel.py:
	  Got rid of add_sheet_view() in Sheet now that the sheet_view_dict
	  is public.

	* [r2154] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Wrote a slice2bounds test. Now there is a pretty heavy testing
	  of: bounds2slice,slice2bounds and also
	  slice2bounds_to_bounds2slice (that test that both function
	  combined together provide an identity function).

2006-01-20  alan_lindsay

	* [r2153] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Fixed a few wee bugs in the popup menu.

	* [r2152] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Add order to objects drawn in the canvas. Allow for order to be
	  changed, in popup menu.

2006-01-20  julienciroux

	* [r2151] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Finished to write the test for bounds2slice. I think it is enough
	  testing for this function now.

	* [r2150] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Modified slice2bounds and bounds2slice so that the bounds
	  returned by slice2bounds do not have any additional margins; the
	  margin is now built internally to bounds2slice, and therefore
	  slice2bounds return the exact bounds. I had to slightly (and
	  temporarily, because Chris is still working on it) modified
	  connectionfield.py.

2006-01-19  alan_lindsay

	* [r2149] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editortools.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  All possible import * occurrences omitted

	* [r2148] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py:
	  Ok button added to objects properties window. Updates and closes.

2006-01-19  ceball

	* [r2147] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  No visible change. Altered call to ConnectionField.__init__().

2006-01-18  alan_lindsay

	* [r2146] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py:
	  Lateral Connections colour when they have the focus.

	* [r2145] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py:
	  Connections from a sheet from one neuron. Lateral connection
	  ovals can be selected and their properties obtained. Labels
	  highlight when their object is selected and they sit (right
	  justified) on the left of their object.

	* [r2144] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Order of boundary search changed to allow lateral connections to
	  be selected.

	* [r2143] topo/tkgui/editortools.py:
	  More distinct display of focus

2006-01-18  jdepaula

	* [r2142] topo/misc/inlinec.py,
	  topographica_script.py:
	  Make loading weave on Windows non-default

	* [r2141] external/win32/setup.py:
	  Now uses Python 2.4.2

	* [r2140] external/win32/python-2.4.2.msi:
	  Upgrade Python 2.4 to 2.4.2

	* [r2139] setup.bat:
	  Upgrade Python 2.4.2 for Windows

2006-01-18  jbednar

	* [r2138] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Added ALERT

	* [r2137] CONVENTIONS,
	  doc/Developer_Manual,
	  doc/Developer_Manual/.cvsignore,

	  Added Judith's suggestion

2006-01-18  julienciroux

	* [r2135] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed the code for toggle normalize so that it just regenerate
	  the normalized plots but not re-run the do_plot command.

	* [r2134] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Changed the code for normalizing, introduced an offset so that
	  the minimum value of the matirx is zero.

2006-01-18  ceball

	* [r2133] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Weight (and mask) patterns are setup using the bounds as
	  calculated by initialize_slice_array(). This corrects the weights
	  near the edges of sheets. There should be no visible change to
	  simulations that were using a weights_generator or
	  w?\004eights_shape that was a pattern such as UniformRandom() or
	  Constant() (as opposed to a Disk() or Gaussian(), which were
	  being incorrectly calculated at the edge of Sheets).

2006-01-18  louisem

	* [r2132] examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty:
	  Cleaned up alpha and radius; might work now. Enabled
	  DivisiveSumNormalize

2006-01-18  ceball

	* [r2131] topographica_script.py:
	  Undid previous change - commandline.py is in topo/misc/, not
	  topo/base/.

2006-01-18  jdepaula

	* [r2130] topographica_script.py:
	  Someone missed this file when they moved commandline.py

2006-01-17  ceball

	* [r2129] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Added a partial test of bounds2slice(). I think bounds2slice()
	  might be incorrect - needs to be investigated (I might be
	  confused).

2006-01-17  jbednar

	* [r2128] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Replaced testing version of RGB plot with a real RGB CoG plot

	* [r2127] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Cleaned up imports and minor spelling errors. Cleaned up
	  commented-out display functions, and Julien made them work with
	  the current version of the GUI (though they still aren't clean
	  enough to leave uncommented). Fixed non-cyclic features to use an
	  inclusive frange.

	* [r2126] topo/analysis/updatecommands.py:
	  Added measure_cog command

	* [r2125] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Added inclusive option to frange

	* [r2124] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added hack useful for MeasureFeatureMap

	* [r2123] topo/analysis/updatecommands.py:
	  Expanded HACKALERT description

	* [r2122] topo/analysis/updatecommands.py:
	  Changed SineGratingPresenter to be a general PatternPresenter
	  class that accepts any PatternGenerator

	* [r2121] topo/analysis/updatecommands.py:
	  Changed measure_or_pref to accept a presenter object instead of a
	  presenter class

	* [r2120] topo/analysis/featuremap.py,
	  topo/analysis/updatecommands.py:
	  Moved sim argument out of SineGratingPresenter __init__ and put
	  it in __call__ instead

	* [r2119] external/Makefile:
	  Fixed bug in previous commit

	* [r2118] topo/analysis/updatecommands.py,
	  topo/commands/basic.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Removed unused sim argument in pattern_present

	* [r2117] external/Makefile:
	  Forced matplotlib to be remade when Python changes, because it
	  seems to require that

	* [r2116] ChangeLog:
	  Up-to-date version of changes

2006-01-17  ceball

	* [r2115] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Minor correction plus put back RN=32.0 in case that's the
	  problem.

2006-01-16  julienciroux

	* [r2114]
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Directly access the Sheet.sheet_view_dict, instead of the
	  add_sheet_view function the SheetViews. The function
	  add_sheet_view will be soon deleted when all similar calls (in
	  other files) will have been replaced.

	* [r2113] topo/analysis/updatecommands.py:
	  Directly access the Sheet.sheet_view_dict, instead of the
	  add_sheet_view function to store the Activity sheetviews. The
	  function add_sheet_view will be soon deleted when all similar
	  calls (in other files) will have been replaced.

	* [r2112] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Directly access the Sheet.sheet_view_dict, instead of the
	  add_sheet_view function to store the feature preference and
	  selectivity sheetviews. The function add_sheet_view will be soon
	  deleted when all similar calls (in other files) will hav?\004e
	  been replaced.

2006-01-16  ceball

	* [r2111] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Added test for weights.

	* [r2110]
	  topo/tests/or_map_topo.000001p000.Eye0_Activity.matrix,
	  topo/tests/or_map_topo.000001p000.Primary_Activity.matrix:

	  C++ LISSOM values from or_map_topo.param version 1.6

2006-01-16  julienciroux

	* [r2108] topo/analysis/updatecommands.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Added a parameter proj_name to set before calling
	  update_projection(), so that we only request UnitView for a given
	  projection.

	* [r2107] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Corrected Unit_View in CFSheet so that it only installs UnitView
	  in the sheet_view_dict but does not do any look_up or does not
	  return any UnitView object. Also added a test for making sure
	  that we request UnitView from CFProjections only,?\004 and added
	  the possibility to pass a projection name to only request
	  UnitViews from the requested projection (or for all of them if
	  projection_name == None).

	* [r2106] topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py:
	  Got rid of the call to PlotGroup do_plot_cmd that no longer
	  exists. It has to be replaced by a call to update_projection, but
	  it will be done when re-writing entirely PlotFileSaver.

	* [r2105] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Got rid of the now un-used attribute shape and corresponding
	  ALERT! (It has been forgotten in the last commit.)

	* [r2104] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Cleaned up old ALERTS: got rid of the unused FLAT constant and
	  PlotGroup shape attribute, deleted PlotGroup do_plot_cmd() that
	  is now unused.

	* [r2103] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Replaced generate_coords() in ProjectionPlotGroup and made it
	  non-private so that it is callable from the projectionpanel.py.
	  It enables to keep executing the
	  updatecommands.update_projection() from the projectionpanel.

2006-01-16  jbednar

	* [r2102] doc/Future_Work/index_text.php:
	  Minor clarifications, plus added Eyal notes

	* [r2101] doc/Downloads/index_text.php:
	  Fixed the explanation of upgrading to the very latest release

	* [r2100] CONVENTIONS:
	  Added section about ALERTs

2006-01-15  ceball

	* [r2099] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  To match C++ LISSOM's samples/or_map_topo.param version 1.6. This
	  version is for Topographica as of 2005/12/21 00:00. It will be
	  updated for the current version of Topographica as testing
	  proceeds from that date in December.

	* [r2098]
	  topo/tests/or_map_topo.000001p000.Eye0_Activity.matrix,
	  topo/tests/or_map_topo.000001p000.Primary_Activity.matrix:
	  From C++ LISSOM's samples/or_map_topo.param version 1.6

	* [r2097] topo/tests/lissom_log_parser.py:
	  Added function to read in C++ LISSOM .matrix file.

	* [r2096] topo/tests/or_map_topo.log:
	  Values from C++ LISSOM's or_map_topo.param version 1.6

2006-01-14  julienciroux

	* [r2095] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Added a scheduled action deleted by mistake on a previous commit.

2006-01-14  jbednar

	* [r2094] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Minor cleanup; shouldn't have affected results

2006-01-14  julienciroux

	* [r2093] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Rounded the value assigned to the input learning rate for the
	  scheduled actions (left temporary comments with original values).

	* [r2092] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Rounded the value assigned to the excitatory learning rate for
	  the scheduled action (left temporary comment with original
	  values).

	* [r2091] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Rounded the initial values of the three learning rates (input,
	  exc, inh).

	* [r2090] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Got rid of a scheduled action that had no effect on the
	  simulation.

	* [r2089] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Rounded the numerical value for declaring the inhibitory weights
	  bounding box.

	* [r2088] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Rounded the numerical value for declaring the afferent weights
	  bounding box.

	* [r2087] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Rounded the numerical value for declaring the Gaussian size
	  parameter.

	* [r2086] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Rounded the value for declaring the input_bounds. Also replaced
	  the fraction for declaring the Gaussian size by its numerical
	  expression.

	* [r2085] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Changed expression written as fraction to replace them by the
	  numerical expression as they are calculated by Python. Next step
	  is to round these values and still have a valid simulation.

2006-01-13  ceball

	* [r2084] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Skips first C++ LISSOM input pattern...which C++ LISSOM skips
	  also?

	* [r2083] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Corrected conversion from C++ LISSOM's cx and cy.
	  retina_edge_buffer set to match C++ LISSOM's - might not be
	  correct.

2006-01-13  alan_lindsay

	* [r2082] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py:
	  Lateral projections represented as dotted circles; labels appear
	  when hovered over and properties set through the projection's
	  sheet. In bounds calculations are determined using full extent of
	  parallelogram or receptive field. Multiple connections have a
	  representation, however labels need sorted.

	* [r2081] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Correction to the import code (doesn't connect connections
	  twice).

2006-01-13  ceball

	* [r2080] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  weights_generator is Constant().

	* [r2079] topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Takes input pattern parameters from a C++ lissom log file.

	* [r2078] topo/tests/lissom_log_parser.py:
	  Used to parse .log files from lissom and return input parameters.

	* [r2077] topo/tests/or_map_topo.log:
	  Initial verison of log file from C++ LISSOM's or_map_topo.params.
	  This initial version is just to setup the testing.

	* [r2076] examples/lissom_or_reference.ty,
	  topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Moved from examples/ to topo/tests/

2006-01-12  ceball

	* [r2075] topo/tests/testlissom.data:
	  Data from 2006/01/09 1315

	* [r2074] topo/tests/testlissom.ty:
	  Added comment about changing the reference data.

	* [r2073] topo/tests/testlissom.data:
	  Added as binary

	* [r2072] topo/tests/testlissom.data:
	  Removed - file should have been added as binary.

	* [r2071] topo/tests/testlissom.ty:
	  Made afferent_weights_bounds larger. Test cases bound to fail
	  right now until the test activities are updated.

2006-01-12  julienciroux

	* [r2070] examples/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  Commented what are the number added to match the old simulation
	  now that the learning rate is divided by the number of unit of
	  the CF at the center.

	* [r2069] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Deleted old JCALERT.

	* [r2068] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Delered the parameter rows and cols that were passed to
	  CFLearningFunction.single_connection_learning_rate(), they are
	  now retrieved from the cfs parameter instead of being passed.

	* [r2067] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Changed the name of set_learning_rate() to
	  single_connection_learning_rate() in CFLearningFunction, and
	  wrote the documentation for this function. Also changed the
	  parameter single_cf_learning_rate to be
	  single_connection_learning_rate in all sub-classes of
	  CFLearningFunction. Got rid of old JABALERT about the learning
	  rate handling.

2006-01-12  ceball

	* [r2066] topo/tests/testlissom.ty:
	  Updated to use pickled data file testlissom.data.

	* [r2065] topo/tests/testlissom.data:
	  Pickled data for use with the test file. Data from release_0_8_1.

	* [r2064] topo/tests/testlissom.ty:
	  Was running with slightly different results each time. I have no
	  idea why - the random and RandomArray seeds were set. I replaced
	  all the lissom code again and it seems to run with the same
	  results every time now. Test values to follow...?\004

2006-01-12  julienciroux

	* [r2063] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Cleaned up the new lissom_or.ty.

2006-01-12  ceball

	* [r2062] topo/tests/testlissom.ty:
	  The previous commit contained incorrect activity arrays.

	* [r2061] topo/tests/testlissom.ty:
	  Test values come from release_0_8_1.

2006-01-12  julienciroux

	* [r2060] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  New version of lissom_or.ty without any old Lissom parameters
	  explicilty declared. This version matches exactly the old one
	  (which is now saved as lissom_or_reference.ty.

	* [r2059] examples/lissom_or_reference.ty:
	  The former lissom_or.ty file has been renamed
	  lissom_or_reference.ty.The former lissom_or.ty will be replaced
	  by a simpler version that won't declare any of the old Lissom
	  parameters.

2006-01-12  ceball

	* [r2058] topo/tests/testlissom.ty:
	  Rough initial version.

	* [r2057] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Had to add a hack for detection of zero in the mask values.
	  Removed a stray '*' (that was having no effect).

	* [r2056] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Corrected a mistake in the previous version of DivisiveHebbian
	  where even unmasked values were used to calculate the total
	  weight change. Made application of the mask simpler and more
	  efficient by doing it in the same loop as the weight
	  mo?\004dification. Added HACKALERT about how to make the code
	  clearer.

2006-01-12  jbednar

	* [r2055] topo/tests/tkgui/testmatplotlibtk.py:
	  Tried to make the test be skipped when there is no display, but
	  without any apparent effect

	* [r2054] doc/User_Manual/index_text.php:
	  Added note about citations

	* [r2053] doc/Downloads/index_text.php:
	  Cleaned up Mac instructions

	* [r2052] topo/base/connectionfield.py:

2006-01-11  ceball

	* [r2051] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Added HACKALERT; changed order of output_fn and mask as a
	  temporary solution.

	* [r2050] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Added HACKALERT

	* [r2049] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Removed code accidentally left behind.

	* [r2048] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Minor change to DivisiveHebbian_CPointer C code to improve speed.

	* [r2047] topo/tests/testlissom_cpointer.ty:
	  Initial version, based on examples/lissom_or.ty version 1.42.

	* [r2046] topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/projections/optimized.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  LISSOM_CPointer and its various optimized functions now respects
	  the mask of the weights.

	* [r2045] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Corrected learning_rate setting in DivisiveHebbian_CPointer.

	* [r2044] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Minor alteration to DivisiveHebbian C code to improve speed.

	* [r2043] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  The DivisiveHebbian C code now respects the mask. Added a
	  hackalert about the name, and slightly changed 1 another
	  hackalert.

	* [r2042] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Made cf's mask array be the same type as the weights array, and
	  made it savespace(1). Had to do the same on change_bounds because
	  it appears that using Numeric.where() causes these attributes to
	  be lost.

	* [r2041] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed apparently redundant use of savespace(). The savespace
	  and typecode attributes of the weights matrix appear to be kept
	  anyway. If they weren't, typecode would need to be set again
	  anyway.

2006-01-11  julienciroux

	* [r2040] external,
	  external/.cvsignore:
	  Ignore Python-2.4.2 directory.

2006-01-11  ceball

	* [r2039] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Added missing import statement.

2006-01-10  julienciroux

	* [r2038] topo/analysis/updatecommands.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/plotting/templates.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Moved the function _generate_coords() from ProjectionPlotGroup to
	  ProjectionPanel. Wrote the function update_projections in
	  analysis/updatecommands.py. Now this command is executed instead
	  of do_plot_cmd() in ProjectionPlotGroup (that has been deleted).

	* [r2037] topo/plotting/plotengine.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/__init__.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotengine.py,

	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Deleted plotengine.py (and testplotengine.py). Now, the PlotGroup
	  objects are stored in a variable plotgroup_dict declared in
	  plotgroup.py. From the panel, the plotgroup_dict is accessed, and
	  if the requested PlotGroup is not found, it is directly created
	  from the panel. Corresponding changes have been made in some test
	  files and in PlotFileSaver.

2006-01-10  ceball

	* [r2036] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed line I left in by accident at some time in the past.

2006-01-10  julienciroux

	* [r2035] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Got rid of now unused do_plot_cmd() function in
	  UnitWeightPlotGroup() (replaced by update_weights in
	  analysis/updatecommands.py). Simplified the do_plot_cmd in
	  ProjectionPlotGroup: the goal is too soon replace it by an
	  update_projection command in analysis/updatecommands.py.

2006-01-10  ceball

	* [r2034] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed unused import statement.

	* [r2033] examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Moved SharedWeightProjection and SharedWeightCFResponseFunction
	  from topo/base/connectionfield.py to topo/projections/basic.py.
	  Renamed SharedWeightProjection to SharedWeightCFProjection.

	* [r2032] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  No visible changes (only changed commented-out code). LGNOn
	  projections' output_fns set to DivisiveSumNormalize(). Added
	  LGNOff. Called DivisiveSumNormalize() with norm_value=-1.0 where
	  projections' strengths are -1.0 so that activities' signs aren't
	  reversed. On and Off channels appear to work (which you can see
	  if you normalize the activity in the GUI).

	* [r2031] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Added HACKALERT to DivisiveSumNormalize.

	* [r2030] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Removed HACKALERT. I realize now that although the syntax for
	  Numeric.clip() implies it is an in-place operation, the array
	  must really be copied.

	* [r2029] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Undid change in previous commit. Why doesn't Numeric.clip() work
	  here?

	* [r2028] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  No visible changes. Changed use of output_fn() so the syntax
	  matches the in-place operation.

	* [r2027] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Used Numeric's clip() rather than utils.clip_in_place(). See the
	  hackalert.

	* [r2026] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  No visible changes. Used xrange() to generate a loop instead of
	  range(), and inside large loops that will run often avoided some
	  evaluations.

2006-01-09  ceball

	* [r2025] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added HACKALERT about already-known masking problem.

	* [r2024] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Added dest_port to connections for LGNOn (change is to
	  commented-out code, so no visible effect).

	* [r2023] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Added HACKALERT about ports.

2006-01-09  julienciroux

	* [r2022] doc/Downloads/index_text.php:
	  Added instructions for building Topographica on Mac OS X 10.4
	  (Tiger), in the Downloads section of the /doc/ directory. It may
	  have to reviewed by a native english speaker.

	* [r2021] external/Python-2.4.tgz:
	  remove Python-2.4.tgz from external/.

	* [r2020] external/Makefile,
	  external/Python-2.4.2.tgz:
	  Replaced Python-2.4 by Python-2.4.2 in the external packages, and
	  made the corresponding changes to the external/Makefile. This
	  upgrade allows to get rid of a warning appearing in the Mac
	  version of Python-2.4.

	* [r2019] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty,
	  topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Changed the handling of the learning rate: now the learning rate
	  (as it is applied when passing to connectionfield.hebbian()) has
	  been divided by the number of unit in the receptive field of the
	  unit at the center of the sheet. The learning rate is set by a
	  function set_learning_rate in CFLearningFunction, and has to be
	  called by the subclasses of CFLearningFunction. Changes have been
	  made to the simulation scripts in order to match the former
	  situation, these changes have been heavily tested.

2006-01-08  jbednar

	* [r2018] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed apparently unneeded set_cfs function. Changed base class
	  of SharedWeightProjection to be CFProjection instead of
	  Projection. Added ALERTs.

	* [r2017] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Fixed radius/diameter confusion for circular RF masks

	* [r2016] topo/base/simulator.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Added ALERTs

	* [r2015] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py:
	  Changed Update to Apply, and added ALERT

	* [r2014] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Changed commented-out example SharedWeightProjection to a
	  prototype of an ON channel

2006-01-07  jbednar

	* [r2013] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Corrections to messages and documentation

	* [r2012] topo/analysis/updatecommands.py:
	  Added ALERTs

	* [r2011] topo/__init__.py:
	  Updated list for import *

2006-01-07  julienciroux

	* [r2010] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty:
	  Added control of the input stream seed and weight stream seed for
	  all the examples currently implemented. That way, the simulation
	  are always similar, which enables easy testing.

	* [r2009] topo/tests/testplotengine.py:
	  Got rid of old commented out code in testplotengine.

2006-01-07  ceball

	* [r2008] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Added note about the radius of the afferent projection's
	  connecttionfields.

	* [r2007] examples/cfsom_or.ty:
	  No visible change - removed some commented-out code.

	* [r2006] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  No visible change: checked in commented-out code. The code is an
	  example SharedWeightProjection. (Also added another note.)

	* [r2005] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  SharedWeightProjection stores the slice indexes and bounds of
	  units (and still just the single set of weights). This allows
	  shared weight response functions to use the correct
	  activity_matrix slice, and SharedWeightProjection.get_view() to
	  get the correct bounds for a unit. The slices and bounds are
	  stored to avoid having to calculate them each time e.g. a
	  response function is called. Also added some hackalerts
	  (including minor ones about code unrelated to that being
	  committed here).

2006-01-06  julienciroux

	* [r2004] topo/plotting/templates.py,
	  topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Changed templates.py, unitweightpanel.py and cfsheetpanel.py so
	  that now it executes the command update_weight defines in
	  updatecommands.py and declared in the UnitWeight template,
	  instead of using the do_plot_cmd in UnitWeightPlotGroup.

	* [r2003] topo/analysis/featuremap.py,
	  topo/analysis/updatecommands.py,
	  topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Moved the updatecommands (e.g. update_activity), from
	  featuremap.py to a new file updatecommands.py in the analysis
	  directory. Made the corresponding change in the import in
	  BasicPlotGroupPanel.

2006-01-06  jbednar

	* [r2002] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  Cleaned up documentation

	* [r2001] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added alerts

2006-01-06  ceball

	* [r2000] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  No visible change. Added commented-out code to allow the shape of
	  the weights to be specified.

	* [r1999] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  ConnectionField's mask (for weights) has a threshold (temporarily
	  hard-coded rather than being user-definable).

2006-01-06  julienciroux

	* [r1998] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Got rid of the unused function release_sheetviews both in Plot
	  and PlotGroup. It has ot be re-defined if we want to re-implement
	  this functionnality.

2006-01-06  ceball

	* [r1997] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Corrected a mistake (changed Int to Numeric.Int32).

2006-01-05  ceball

	* [r1996] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Added HACKALERT about inheritance of default values for
	  Parameters.

	* [r1995] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added weights_shape to SharedWeightProjection.

	* [r1994] examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty:
	  Temporarily commented line that sets default
	  PatternGeneratorParameter.

	* [r1993] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  No visible change (I hope) (except the example files temporarily
	  do not default to a particular PatternGenerator for e.g. the test
	  pattern window) , although simulations will run a little slower.
	  Added code to allow ConnectionFields to have a shape
	  (CFProjection has a weights_shape Parameter). The default shape
	  is Constant (i.e. the same rectangular shape as before).

	* [r1992] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Changed references to topo.base.patterngenerator to
	  patterngenerator.

	* [r1991] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  No visible change - small alteration to code.

2006-01-04  ceball

	* [r1990] topo/tkgui/__init__.py:
	  Imported all LearningFunctions and ResponseFunctions for the GUI.

	* [r1989] topo/responsefns/__init__.py:
	  Code to populate ResponseFunctionParameter's range().

	* [r1988] topo/learningfns/__init__.py:
	  Code to populate LearningFunctionParameter's range().

	* [r1987] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Added HACKALERT about classname_repr().

	* [r1986] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added LearningFunctionParameter and ResponseFunctionParameter.
	  Made response_fn and learning_fn attributes into
	  ResponseFunctionParameters and LearningFunctionParameters.

	* [r1985] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Added a comment about using xrange() instead of range().

	* [r1984] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Changed height and width to size and aspect ratio (I missed when
	  I made the change from height and width to size and aspect_ratio.
	  Added notes about (1) specifying size and aspect_ratio here in
	  the first place and (2) there being no warnin?\004g when the
	  non-parameter attributes height and width were being set (I spent
	  a long, long time finding this bug).

2006-01-02  ceball

	* [r1983] topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added a HACKALERT noting problems in the unlikely case of
	  zero-sized or very small density matrices being specified.

	* [r1982] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Added HACKALERT.

	* [r1981] topo/base/projection.py:
	  Changed output_fn to be an OutputFunctionParameter.

2005-12-31  ceball

	* [r1980] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Made the output_fn be an OutputFunctionParameter.

	* [r1979] topo/__init__.py:
	  Added HACKALERT.

	* [r1978] topo/base/parameter.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/base/projection.py,
	  topo/outputfns/__init__.py,
	  topo/patterns/__init__.py,
	  topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py,
	  topo/tkgui/__init__.py:
	  Part-way checkin. ClassSelectorParameters (such as
	  PatternGeneratorParameter) can now be declared in the correct
	  file (topo.base.patterngenerator in this example) because the
	  list of available classes (PatternGenerators in this case) is
	  added to in the relevant __init__.py file
	  (topo/patterns/__init__.py in this case). The list of available
	  classes comes from the imported modules in the package, so the
	  GUI does e.g. 'from topo.patterns import *' to make all options
	  available. There are other ClassSelectorParameters still to add,
	  and the documentation is incomplete.

	* [r1977] topo/outputfns/__init__.py,
	  topo/patterns/__init__.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Changed name of PackageParameter to ClassSelectorParameter.

	* [r1976] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Changed name of PackageParameter to ClassSelectorParameter. Made
	  DynamicNumber's setting error message slightly more informative.

	* [r1975] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Commented out some currently unused code.

2005-12-30  ceball

	  Some simplifications.

	* [r1970] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:

	* [r1968] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py:
	  Continued to cleaned up widgets in taggedslider.py (not yet
	  finished). Gave the idea of 'string_translator' widgets an
	  existence with a TranslatorWidget base class. We might want to
	  change the name.

2005-12-28  ceball

	* [r1967] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py:
	  Read-only properties are displayed with a label rather than a

	  This checkin was part of an approximately 10-kilometre diff, so

	* [r1937] examples/lissom_or_20000.typ:
	  I trained another map. I like training maps. This one was for
	  changes to the way Sheet computes density.

	* [r1936] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Added hack to reverse the order of the 'present in:' buttons.

	* [r1935] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  'Install as class defaults' button hidden for the moment.

	* [r1934] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  GeneratorSheet bounds are set on the class, as in the other
	  examples. This makes more sense than setting them on the specific
	  Retina used in this example, I think.

	* [r1933] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py:
	  Constant parameters are displayed but cannot be edited (EntryEval
	  gets a 'readonly' config option...please feel free to change the
	  background color). How to deal with Constants for a class is left
	  for another day...

	* [r1932] topo/patterns/__init__.py:
	  Added HACKALERT.

	* [r1931] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  density and bounds are Constant parameters.

	* [r1930] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Changed Constant so that its value can be set on a class, but not
	  on an object.

	* [r1929] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Removed unused import of Constant

	* [r1928] topo/patterns/__init__.py:
	  PatternGenerators don't have 'Generator' cut off their name in
	  menus. Either we rename PatternGenerator to Pattern (so
	  LineGenerator to Line, and all the rest), or we do something like
	  alter the name attribute of the PatternGenerator c?\004lass. Or
	  someone has a better idea...

	* [r1927] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Removed print statement left in by accident.

	* [r1926] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py:
	  PropertiesFrame gets a checkbutton property, which is
	  CheckbuttonEval (added to taggedslider.py). ParametersFrame now
	  deals with Boolean Parameters.

2005-12-21  alan_lindsay

	* [r1925] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Creates a window holding a ParametersFrame, when properties is
	  selected from popup, or EditorObject is double clicked.

	  topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/patterns/image.py,
	  topo/patterns/random.py,
	  topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  - Added xdensity and ydensity that stores the true densities
	  along x
	  and y to the class Sheet. These densities are different from the
	  density
	  parameter when the width or height of the sheet bounds multiplied
	  by
	  density is not a integer. The size of the sheet matrix will be
	  the
	  integer part of that product and therefore the real density is
	  less than
	  the parameter by no more than 1. These real densities are
	  important for
	  computing the conversion between sheet and matrix coordinates,
	  which
	  were computed in these conversion functions.

	  There are two reasons for moving them into the sheet:
	  1) more efficient because the true densities are cached in Sheet
	  2) It ensure the same densities are used across all conversion
	  functions and different bounds.

	  - All conversion functions between matrix and sheet coordinates
	  now
	  require BOTH the true x and y densities.

2005-12-20  jbednar

2005-12-20  alan_lindsay

	* [r1920] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Allow the editor to import models from the simulator. If the topo
	  Sheets don't have gui coords strored, uses random numbers to
	  position them.

	* [r1919] topo/tkgui/editortools.py:
	  Add topo sheets as they are made, rather than when they are
	  connected.

	* [r1918] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py:
	  Small refinements; nicer.

2005-12-20  ceball

	* [r1917] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:

	* [r1916] examples/lissom_or_20000.typ:
	  Updated trained network after changes to lissom_or.ty's
	  parameters.

2005-12-20  yfsit

	* [r1915] examples/lissom_or.ty:

	  weights.

2005-12-19  alan_lindsay

	* [r1914] topo/tkgui/editortools.py:
	  First attempt solution of Pmw/Tkinter Menu item clash

2005-12-19  ceball

	* [r1913] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  After loading a saved network, GaussianGenerators are only
	  installed in the GeneratorSheets if GaussianGenerator has already
	  been imported. This is a hack of a hack so that a
	  GaussianGenerator is restored to the GeneratorSheets in the
	  liss?\004om_or.ty example (but does not raise an error for other
	  cases).

2005-12-19  jbednar

	* [r1912] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py:
	  Removed filling of CF oval, to eventually allow activity pattern
	  to show through.

2005-12-19  ceball

	* [r1911] examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  PatternGeneratorParameter.default should be a
	  PatternGeneratorParameter instance, not a class.

	* [r1910] examples/cfsom_or.ty:
	  Corrected previous commit: BoundingBox is now imported from
	  topo.base.boundingregion, which is what I meant to type.

	* [r1909] examples/cfsom_or.ty:
	  BoundingBox is now imported from topo.base.sheet instead of
	  topo.base.patterngenerator.

	* [r1908] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Added a hack to have a DynamicNumber not display as a
	  DynamicNumber in a ParametersFrame while we figure out how to do
	  deal with DynamicNumbers properly.

	  topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Got rid of now unused got for handling static plot_list in
	  PlotGroup; plot_list is always a dynamic list. Fixed an hack in
	  the plotgrouppanel subclasses that was relating to that.

	* [r1898] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Changed initialize_plot_list so that to only have dynamic list
	  and still have the possibility to pass an already built plot_list
	  when creating a PlotGroup. Made corresponding changes in the
	  plotgrouppanel classes.

	* [r1897] topo/plotting/plotengine.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Got rid of the possibility of passing lambda function as a filter
	  in PlotGroup; instead always pass a string (sheet_name) or None,
	  and build the corresponding lambda function in the PlotGroup
	  constructor. Simplified PlotEngine accordingly.

	* [r1896] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Changed the name of the temporary test template for RGBPlot.

	* [r1895] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Cleaned up the file by getting rid of old comments and alerts.

	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Got rid of the PlotTemplate class in template. Now, a
	  plot_template is simply a dictionary associated to a name in the
	  KeyedList() plot_templates attribute of a PlotGroupTemplate.
	  Coresponding changes have been made in some tests files, and in
	  PlotGroup, PlotFileSaver and the PlotGroupPanels. I also got rid
	  of the attribute description of a PlotGroupTemplate, that was a
	  simple copy of the name attribute, and made the correponding
	  changes in TopoConsole.

	* [r1888] topo/plotting/plot.py:

	  PaletteBitmap. Made corresponding changes in plot and testfiles.

	* [r1881] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Modified __slice_matrices() and moved it from HSVPlot to Plot. It
	  is now a simple routine that only works on one matrix.

	* [r1880] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Cleaned up doc and comments.

	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Continued modification of parametersframe and propertiesframe,
	  and associated files. Particularly, the way testpattern works is
	  changing. Some changes are here so that things carry on working
	  during the reorganization; nevertheless, the ability to choose
	  whether or not a generatorsheet's preview window is updated in
	  the test pattern window is temporarily gone. Most of the methods
	  involved in presenting patterns in the test pattern window are
	  already subject to JABHACKALERTS.

2005-12-16  julienciroux

	* [r1878] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Added the call to TopoObject __init__ from Plot. Allowed to get
	  rid of the parameter name in Plot and passing it as a TopoObject
	  param. Also get rid of default value for Plot subclasses RGBPlot
	  and ColormapPlot.

	* [r1877] topo/plotting/bitmap.py,
	  topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Eliminated redundant clipping. Now it only clips in
	  Bitmap._arrayToImage() if the value are over 255. No other
	  clipping is performed before. Also eliminated unused part of the
	  code (e.G. attribute cropped in Plot, normalizing in
	  _arrayToImage).

	* [r1876] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Cleaned up the doc. Got rid of the matrix_hsv_to_rgb() (it was
	  supposed to be done on my last commit... it is now). Got rid of
	  unused default value in Plot.__init__. Changed the name of a
	  parameter from resu to plot.

	* [r1875] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testplot.py:
	  Changed Plot so that it has an attribute Bitmap, rather than a
	  three tuple of rgb_matrices. From PlotGroup, the bitmap is
	  directly taken, without having to worry about which kind of
	  Bitmap it is (i.e. HSV,RGB or Pallette), the different case
	  beeing handled within Plot without anyone having to know about it
	  from outside. The TestPlot file has been temporary commented out
	  and has to be re-written so that to work with Bitmaps rather than
	  Matrices. The function matrix_hsv_to_rgb is no longer used by
	  Plot, but have been moved to testplot, in case we need it for
	  testing purpose in the future.

	* [r1874] topo/plotting/bitmap.py:
	  New version of HSVMap. It is a copy of the code of the soon to be
	  unused matrix_hsv_to_rgb() function.

	* [r1873] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Simplified the function load_images() in PlotGroup: got rid of
	  unused tests and clipping. Intermediary step before directly
	  returning a bitmap from Plot.

	  Moved mostly-unused BLACK_BACKGROUND and WHITE_BACKGROUND options
	  to the only place they are used, in palette.py. Removed unused
	  MONITOR_BASED_PLOTS and PAPER_BASED_PLOTS.

	* [r1863] topo/plotting/plot.py:

	* [r1859] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testplot.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  New version of Plot that now works with subclasses
	  HSVPlot,RGBPlot and ColormapPlot. It is the first version for
	  this code: only HSVPlot is implemented, and there is still things
	  to change (e.g. using the Bitmap class from Plot instead of the
	  matrix_hsv_to_rgb). Corresponding changes have been made in
	  plotgroup.py, testpattern.py and testplot.py.

	  topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,

2005-12-15  julienciroux

	* [r1845] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Just got rid of the default value for template and plot_group_key

	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Removed non-functioning reset_to_defaults() method from

	  in Plot, that now return and works with a three-tuple.

	* [r1836] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testplot.py:
	  Made the Plot.matrices attribute beeing a three-tuple instead of

	  Cleaned up the code: got rid of attribute normalize and situated,
	  they are now passed as a parameter only. Rename situated to
	  situate.

2005-12-15  ceball

	* [r1832] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Removed menu separator that is no longer required.

2005-12-14  jbednar

	* [r1831] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Added retina edge buffer

	* [r1830] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added ALERT

	* [r1829] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Fixed typos

2005-12-14  ceball

	* [r1828] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Two separate changes (sorry). (1) class_parameters() returns a
	  dict. (2) Holding the mouse over a Parameter's name brings up the
	  Parameter's __doc__.

	* [r1827] topo/base/topoobject.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  class_parameters() returns a dict.

	* [r1826] topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py:
	  Minor change - no visible changes.

	* [r1825] topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py:
	  Updated a comment that I forgot on the previous update.

	* [r1824] topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py:
	  Slider only updates after 'return' is pressed in the tag box.
	  This prevents the tag limits changing to really big values after
	  accidental inclusion of e.g. an extra 0 while typing. More
	  importantly, expressions for max,min,and val won't be evaluated
	  until the user presses 'return'. This stops evaluation of partial
	  expressions, and is important because now expressions are
	  evaluated in __main__, variables etc. are available.

	* [r1823] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  TaggedSlider no longer has need_to_refresh_sliders attribute.

	* [r1822]
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testpropertiesframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py:
	  TaggedSlider uses utils.eval_atof() to evaluate strings in
	  __main__, rather than using string.atof(). Removed redundant
	  attribute need_to_refresh_slider. Tidied code a little and added
	  small bits of documentation. In anticipation of slider max and
	  min values being set from e.g. evaluated functions (for example
	  when the value is a function and the upper bound must be
	  extended), max and min slider variables are reverted to strings.

2005-12-14  jbednar

	* [r1821] topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Fixed ALERT that was holding up the tests

2005-12-14  julienciroux

	* [r1820] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Cleaned up Plot. Made some sub-function return results rather
	  than modifying Plot attributes. Got rid of now unused attribute.
	  Changed _get_matrices_from_view_dict to __extract_view_dict_info.
	  Made other sub-function private.

	* [r1819] topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Added a temporary add to re-initialize the plot_list of a
	  PlotGroup from a panel. It was done before by the function plot()
	  in Plot, but we need now to re-create a new plot_list anytime
	  (i.e. because the code previously in Plot.plot() is now in
	  Plot.__init__()). This has to implemented in a better way and is
	  only a temporary solution.

2005-12-14  ceball

	* [r1818] topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py:
	  Text boxes update when 'return' is pressed. (This message does
	  not apply to TaggedSliders' text boxes.)

	* [r1817] topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py:
	  TaggedSlider only updates from textbox if 'return' is pressed or
	  the box loses focus. Previously input was passed through to the
	  simulator the second it was typed.

2005-12-14  jbednar

	* [r1816] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Made connect() return the connection created

2005-12-14  alan_lindsay

	* [r1815] topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editortools.py,
	  topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py:
	  Initial CVS version

2005-12-14  julienciroux

	* [r1814] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testplot.py:
	  Moved the code of plot() in __init__(): plot() no longer exists
	  in Plot, and the matrices bitmap are now created when the Plot()
	  object is created. I made the corresponding changes in PlotGroup
	  and TestPlot.

	* [r1813] topo/plotting/plotengine.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotengine.py:
	  Got rid of the unuseful add_plot_group() in PlotEngine; instead
	  it is simpler to directly access the plot_group_dict when adding
	  a PlotGroup. Made the corresponding changes in testplotengine.

2005-12-14  ceball

	* [r1812] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Corrected code accidentally committed in revision 1.33.

	* [r1811] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Subclasses of Parameter now define __slots__ as appropriate.

	* [r1810] topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  Moved classlist() and descendents from() utils.py to parameter.py
	  because it's unlikely for any user not using Parameters to want
	  them.

	* [r1809] topo/base/parameter.py,
	  topo/base/utils.py:
	  Moved classlist() and descendents() from utils.py to parameter.py
	  because it's unlikely for any user not using Parameters to want
	  them.

	* [r1808] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/utils.py:
	  Moved hebbian() from utils.py to connectionfield.py, where it is
	  used.

	* [r1807] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  Removed unused import

	* [r1806] topo/base/topoobject.py,
	  topo/base/utils.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Moved class_parameters() from utils.py to topoobject.py.

	* [r1805] topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py:
	  Renamed inputparamspanel.py to testpattern.py

	* [r1804] topo/tests/tkgui/__init__.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Renamed inputparamspanel.py to testpattern.py, and
	  InputParamsPanel to TestPattern.

	* [r1803] topo/tkgui/testpattern.py:
	  Renamed inputparamspanel.py to testpattern.py

	* [r1802] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Removed auto-refresh menu item. Topoconsole's list of panels to
	  refresh automatically is no longer accessed through functions.

2005-12-14  jbednar

	* [r1801] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Changed DivisiveHebbian_Fallback to DivisiveHebbian_Py

	* [r1800] topo/__init__.py:

2005-12-14  yfsit

	* [r1799] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  - merged the slice tuple in ConnectionField into slice_array.

2005-12-14  jdepaula

	* [r1798] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Added wrapper classes for optimization Fallback to set the
	  correct output_fn for GenericCFLF

2005-12-14  julienciroux

	* [r1797] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testplot.py,
	  topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py:
	  Changed Plot class so that it takes a dictionary specifying the
	  different channels, instead of a three-tuple. That way, it will
	  be easier to extend the code for passing more information to a
	  Plot object. This new change will also enable a better version of
	  the current code of Plot. The call to Plot() has been modified
	  accordingly in plotgroup.py, inputsparampanel.py and testplot.py.

2005-12-13  ceball

	* [r1796] topo/tkgui/__init__.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Changed the import of all patterngenerators to be in
	  tkgui/__init__.py instead of tkgui/topoconsole.py

2005-12-13  jdepaula

	* [r1789] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Gave up on Tkinter Border mechanism, and I now draw a rectangle
	  around the plot instead.

	* [r1788] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Added CANVASBUFFER.

	* [r1787] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Added CANVASBUFFER. Fixed flicker that was introduced by adding
	  borders.

2005-12-13  julienciroux

	* [r1786] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Switched from using MLab.clip() to using Numeric.clip().

2005-12-13  ceball

	  Cleaned up imports, comments, alerts, and documentation

2005-12-13  ceball

	* [r1782] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  When topoconsole loads a new Simulator, it needs to tell itself
	  that the active_sim will have changed.

	* [r1781] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Increasing y was moving the pattern downwards, an error
	  introduced in revision 1.37.

2005-12-13  julienciroux

	* [r1780] topo/plotting/plotengine.py:
	  Cleaned up the doc.

	* [r1779] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Updated the plotgrouptemplate of UnitWeightPlotGroup and
	  ProjectionPlotGroup according to the new changes in plotgroup.py
	  and plot.py.

	* [r1778] topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Got rid of an old part of the code that is no longer used. Now,
	  no information is passed by the UnitWeight template, all is done
	  with the plot_group_key. The template should also be changed in
	  template.py.

	* [r1775] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Got rid of old comments.

2005-12-13  jdepaula

	* [r1774] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Added comment information about BORDERWIDTH and canvas offsets.

	* [r1773] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Added a Hebbian_Py to allow optimized fallback support for
	  Hebbian

	* [r1772] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added output_fn, since CFProjection needed it.

	* [r1771] topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  Added TopoObject import

	* [r1770] topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  Forgot to import optimized

	* [r1769] topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  Added fallback for optimized functions.

	* [r1766] topo/learningfns/optimized.py:
	  Changed incorrect comment, expanded warning message.

	* [r1765] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed unneeded import

2005-12-13  julienciroux

	* [r1764] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Added the possibility to get situated plot. The code is working,
	  but is not in use for the moment (it would require to create
	  Plot() with the option situated=True when creating a plot from
	  the plotgroup class).

2005-12-12  julienciroux

	* [r1763] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Minor change in the code: the self.plot_bounding_box passed as a
	  parameter is no longer use for passing the sheet bounding_box to
	  submatrix(). Instead, this bounds comes from the bigger matrix in
	  self.matrices in the case where slicing is required. This will
	  enable to pass whatever plot_bounding_box for situating the plot
	  if required. Added a comment and an alert about that, because I
	  might not have thought of some special cases (though not yet
	  implemented) where that would not work.

	* [r1762] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Added comments and TO DO notes, updated the doc.

	* [r1761] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Added a function _get_slice() as a subfunction of plot. It
	  consists of the code that deals with slicing the different
	  matrices to the size of the smallest view; it was previously in
	  _make_hsv_matrix.

2005-12-12  yfsit

	* [r1760] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  - Replaced _NumberBoundsException with the buit-in ValueError.

2005-12-12  ceball

	* [r1759] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Updated load_snapshot() to reflect changes to active_sim().

2005-12-12  julienciroux

	* [r1758] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Minor cleaning of the code in _make_hsv_matrix.

	* [r1757] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Cleaned up the code: now the empty plot exception is caught from
	  plot() instead to be caught in the sub-function
	  _make_hsv_matrices() (I think it is clearer); also minor
	  correction to comments.

2005-12-12  jbednar

	* [r1756] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Removed apparently outdated comment

2005-12-12  julienciroux

	* [r1755] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Minor correction of the code in the cropping case. Got rid of
	  some old comments and added new one.

2005-12-12  ceball

	* [r1754] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Altered a hackalert.

	* [r1753] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Added HACKALERT.

	* [r1752] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Reverted accidentally committed change in previous version (where
	  Rectangle's softbounds were removed.

	* [r1751] topo/outputfns/__init__.py,
	  topo/patterns/__init__.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py,
	  topo/patterns/image.py,
	  topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py,
	  topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  PatternGeneratorParameter and OutputFunctionParameter now exist
	  in the __init__ file for their respective packages. They are
	  subclasses of PackageParameter.

	* [r1750] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Added PackageParameter(Parameter) to parameter.py. This is the
	  base class for a Parameter such as an OutputFunctionParameter,
	  which can be set to an OutputFunction and and return a list of
	  available OutputFunctions.

2005-12-12  julienciroux

	* [r1749] topo/projections/optimized.py:
	  Corrected the call to CFProjection.change_bounds to only take two
	  parameters. he optimized.change_bounds method also take two
	  parameters now, as the output_fn is an attribute of CFProjection;
	  that solves the problem that occured when running the optimized
	  version of LISSOM.

2005-12-12  ceball

	* [r1748] topo/base/parameter.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py,
	  topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py:
	  Added PackageParameter to topo/base/parameter.py. This is the
	  base class for Parameters such as PatternGeneratorParameter,
	  which do things like return the list of all types of a class in a
	  package.

	* [r1747] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py:
	  Continued cleaning. Added documentation. ParametersFrame doesn't
	  convert Parameter values to strings - that was already being done
	  by PropertiesFrame. PropertiesFrame defaults to a
	  string_translator of topo.base.utils.eval_atof() instead of
	  string.atof() so that any expression valid at the command line
	  can be entered in the test patterns window (e.g. 'cos(pi/2)', if
	  cos has been imported from math into __main__.__dict__ - that is,
	  if 'from math import cos' has been done at the command line).

	* [r1746]
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testpropertiesframe.py:
	  Number bounds stay as floats (rather than float->string->float).

	* [r1745] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Moved an import statement and added a HACKALERT about it.

	* [r1744] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py:
	  Number bounds stay as floats (rather than float->string->float).

2005-12-12  jdepaula

	* [r1741] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Removed HACKALERT from class_parameters()

	* [r1740] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Moved some documentation to circumvent hidden class docstrings;
	  added HACKALERT about it.

2005-12-12  jdepaula

	* [r1739] topo/misc/inlinec.py:
	  Updated comment

	* [r1738] topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/projections/optimized.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Added Python-only fallback function definition.

	* [r1737] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Restored GenericCFResponseFcn as default response_fn to restore
	  topo.base requirement to not point to outside functions.

	* [r1736] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty:
	  Remove default option for response_fn

	* [r1735] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed optimized switch in CFProjection.

2005-12-11  julienciroux

	* [r1734] topo/plotting/templates.py:
	  Changed the Projection and UnitWeight PlotGroupTemplate so that
	  it colors the plot with OrientationPreference (the Confidence key
	  hasn't been added even though it works).

	* [r1733] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Minor correction.

2005-12-11  ceball

	* [r1732] topo/tests/testcfsom.py,
	  topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py,
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testactivitypanel.py,
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testplotgrouppanel.py:
	  PatternGenerators use aspect_ratio and size rather than height
	  and width.

	* [r1731] examples/cfsom_or.ty:
	  Uses size and aspect_ratio rather than height and width.

	* [r1730] examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty:
	  Uses size and aspect_ratio rather than height and width. Since
	  height and width of the GaussianGenerator are important
	  parameters of the model (for matching other work), they are shown
	  explicitly.

2005-12-11  julienciroux

	* [r1729] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  New version of plot.py that support coloring the weights and
	  projection by passing the 'Hue' and 'Confidence' plot keys define
	  by the UnitWeight or the Projection plotgroup template. The code
	  in plot.py is working but remains to be clarified and simplified.
	  Changes in plotgroup.py are only related to the changes in
	  plot.py.

2005-12-11  ceball

	* [r1728] topo/patterns/basic.py,
	  topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Use size and aspect_ratio rather than height and width.

2005-12-11  julienciroux

	* [r1727] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Corrected an error that I made with CVS. Basically, I had got rid
	  of the changes made by version 1.39 to 1.41 because checking a
	  non-updated code. I re-added these changes and this version is
	  correct.

2005-12-11  ceball

	* [r1726] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Uses same sheet2matrixidx() as is in topo.base.sheet, except this
	  works for scalars and arrays.

	* [r1725] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Added a comment and some commented-out code so my changes don't
	  get left behind. No visible change.

2005-12-11  julienciroux

	* [r1724] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Replaced the code to build the bounds by a call to the new
	  slice2bounds function in sheet. The same code is performed, but
	  it has been moved in slice2bounds so that to have the two
	  function slice2bounds and bounds2slice both in sheet.py.

	* [r1723] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Added a test slice2bounds_bounds2slice that test the
	  transformation from slice to bounds and bounds to slice using the
	  bounds2slice and slice2bounds function.

	* [r1722] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added a function slice2bounds that returns the bounds
	  corresponding to a given slice. This function is the e
	  xact transformation of bounds2slice, i.e. when creating bounds
	  with slice2bounds and convert tham back with bounds2slice, you
	  are sure to have the same slice than at the begining.Also, I got
	  rid of the former old version of bounds2slice that was commented
	  out.

	* [r1721] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Clarified the doc and change bounds_to_slice to its new name
	  bounds2slice in a debug print.

	* [r1720] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Got rid of the function input_slice(). It was previously used to
	  generate the slice for a given ConnectionField, which is now done
	  in the function __initialize_slice in ConnectionField. Also,
	  changed the name of bounds_to_slice to be bounds2slice.

	* [r1719] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Inserted the code that was previously in input_slice from
	  sheet.py to the function __initialize_slice of
	  connectionfield.py. input_slice is no longer used and will be
	  deleted from sheet. Also, modified the bounding box for a weight
	  so that to add a small margin around the bounds (i.e. for solving
	  the problem of getting the right sloces from the bounding box
	  afterwards).

2005-12-11  jbednar

	* [r1718] doc/User_Manual/index_text.php:
	  Added some notes for the manual

2005-12-11  julienciroux

	* [r1717] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  New version of bounds_to_slice (the former one is still there but
	  commented out). This function is not used for the moment, so
	  changing it does not change the way topographica works. Also, I
	  changed bounds2shape to an equivalent version, and updated the
	  comment about that. Both solutions would be reasonnable, and give
	  the appropriate results in the cases where we should use this
	  function (i.E. in patterngenerator and for generating the
	  weights); nevertheless, it is not possible to use this function
	  for implementing the functions that need to transform a slice to
	  bounds and then convert them back, that is why bounds2shape is no
	  longer used by the bounds_to_slice function.

2005-12-11  ceball

	* [r1716] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added some documentation about density to sheet2matrix().

	* [r1715] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Added test that sheet2matrixidx() is the inverse of
	  matrixidx2sheet(). Renamed several functions.

	* [r1714] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Removed a HACKALERT; rearranged some comments.

2005-12-11  jbednar

	* [r1713] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Cleaned up comments and documentation

2005-12-11  yfsit

	* [r1712] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  - checked GenericCFLF() and uncommented the unchecked comment.

	* [r1711] examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty:
	  - updated the comment to reflect the name change from
	  DivisiveL1Normalize to DivisiveSumNormlaize

	* [r1710] examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  topo/eps/basic.py,
	  topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/learningfns/optimized.py,
	  topo/projections/optimized.py:
	  - Added learningfns/optimized.py and move all the learning
	  functions that need weave into it.

2005-12-11  ceball

	* [r1709] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Begun adding in full tests of Sheet defined by non-integer
	  (right-left) and (top-bottom).

	* [r1708] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Added bounds2shape() test. Updated HACKALERT - the tests are not
	  all being run for the awkward case.

	* [r1707] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Continued cleaning tests.

2005-12-10  ceball

	* [r1706] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Continued adding tests for the functions in topo.base.sheet.

	* [r1705] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Tidied up a bit and added some matrix2sheet() tests.
	  matrixidx2sheet() tests haven't been reviewed yet.

	* [r1704] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Removed some documentation I left in by accident.

	* [r1703] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Changed sheet2matrixidx()

	* [r1702] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added HACKALERT to sheet2matrixidx because I think it returns the
	  wrong matrix row or column for some points outside the
	  BoundingBox.

	* [r1701] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Included sheet2matrix tests, and increased testing of
	  sheet2matrixidx. Note that some of the new sheet2matrixidx tests
	  fail. This is because I think sheet2matrixidx is incorrect for
	  points just outside the left bound and points just outside the
	  top bound.

	* [r1700] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Corrected a mistake in my previous comment. No visible change.

	* [r1699] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added a comment about sheet2matrix(). Changed some documentation
	  and a variable name to better describe its use. No visible
	  change.

2005-12-10  jbednar

	* [r1698] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  Clarified alerts, and changed the name of Intersection to clarify
	  that it works only for BoundingBoxes

2005-12-10  jdepaula

	* [r1697] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Changed GenericCF response_fn to CFDotProduct_Py.
	  GenericCFResponseFn() is the same as CFDotProduct_Py. We want to
	  call CFDotProduct_Py instead of GenericCFResponseFn, because the
	  exact behavior of GenericCFResponseFn is controlled?\004 by the
	  single_cf_fn parameter.

2005-12-10  yfsit

	* [r1696] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  - tested Hebbian() and uncommented it.

2005-12-10  jdepaula

	* [r1695] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty:
	  Removed the CFDotProduct assignment since it's now the default
	  for CFProjection

2005-12-09  jdepaula

	* [r1694] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added inlinec.optimized switch for response_fn

2005-12-09  yfsit

	* [r1693] topo/base/simulator.py,
	  topo/tests/testsimulator.py:
	  - Simulator.objects(baseclass) has the default argument
	  baseclass=EventProcessor
	  - Removed Simulator.get_event_processors(), which is essentially
	  the same as Simulator.objects() now
	  - Updated the tests accordingly.

2005-12-09  jdepaula

	* [r1692] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  Commented out Hebbian, comment said it's untested, so may as well
	  make explicit that it's not being used.

	* [r1691] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Adjusted comment

2005-12-09  julienciroux

	* [r1690] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Re-wrote bounds2shape so that it uses sheet2matixidx. This has be
	  done so that all methods that transform sheet information to
	  matrix information do it in a consistent way.

2005-12-09  ceball

	* [r1689] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Tidied documentation a bit and changed some variable names. No
	  visible change.

2005-12-09  jbednar

	* [r1688] topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  Cleaned up imports and comments

	* [r1687] topo/base/parameter.py,
	  topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  Made __doc__ return the doc slot properly when called on a
	  TopoObject, even for subclasses of Parameter, allowing us to
	  remove a hack from TopoMetaclass

2005-12-09  julienciroux

	* [r1686] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Minor change in the doc. Deleted a line of code that were
	  overwritten in bounds_to_slice.

2005-12-09  jbednar

	* [r1685] examples/Makefile,
	  examples/image_example.py,
	  examples/test.ppm:
	  Removed outdated image_example.py and associated image

2005-12-09  ceball

	* [r1684] topo/patterns/image.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Changed name of EnumeratedParameter to Enumeration.

	* [r1683] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Changed the name of EnumeratedParameter to Enumeration. Updated
	  Parameter documentation.

2005-12-09  julienciroux

	* [r1682] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Deleted a comment that I had wrongly added to the last commit.

	* [r1681] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Changed the name of one of the two functions input_slice to be
	  bounds_to_slice (I picked the one that is used by submatrix and
	  only takes three parameters: real bounds, sheet bounds and
	  density. This function, as well as submatrix, is not used for the
	  moment). I also added two ALERTS concerning problem with the
	  future version of plot.

	* [r1680] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Now we pass the real bounds of the weight instead of the sheet
	  bounds when creating a UnitView (in get_view() in CFProjection).
	  Corrected the call to matrix2sheet for creating the bounds in
	  ConnectionField (now the bounding box is really the boundaries of
	  the weight submatrix). Added temporary debug print and deleted a
	  JABHACKALERT.

2005-12-09  yfsit

	* [r1679] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  - removed the unnecssary import * from Numeric

2005-12-08  ceball

	* [r1678] topo/patterns/image.py,
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testpropertiesframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py:
	  Using EnumeratedParameter to allow different types of size
	  normalization for images (i.e. initial scaling of image).
	  Adjusted things in the GUI to allow this. These changes are again
	  intermediate - there will be more to come.

	* [r1677] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Added EnumeratedParameter. It's not finished and not documented
	  but is committed.

2005-12-08  jbednar

	* [r1676] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added real bounds for this ConnectionField

	* [r1675] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Fixed bogus matrix2sheet definition -- was accepting mx, my
	  instead of float_row, float_col (i.e., in the wrong order, though
	  it didn't matter because the function was being called with the
	  order swapped.

	* [r1674] topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Added ALERT about missing tests

	* [r1673] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Added a function __initialize_slice in ConnectionField,
	  containing code shared between __init__ and change_bounds. Made
	  it clearer that the ConnectionField weight_bounds parameter is
	  actually only a weights_bounds_template, and that x and y are
	  locations in the input sheet, not the sheet owning this
	  ConnectionField.

	* [r1672] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Clarified by changing name and arguments of activity_submatrix to
	  reflect their generality. Removed unused activity_submatrix
	  method of Sheet.

	* [r1671] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed unused self.bounds and contains() of ConnectionField

	  topo/tests/testplot.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheetview.py:
	  Removed ImageGenerator class from patterngenerator.py. It wasn't
	  being used any more by Topographica (there is already one in
	  patterns/image.py), but it is being used by test files - so now
	  it's in testsheetview.py.

2005-12-08  jbednar

	* [r1669] topo/misc,
	  topo/misc/.cvsignore:
	  Copied from base

	* [r1650] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/hierarchical.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty:
	  Changed confusing bit -- had been specifying weights bounding box
	  as a parameter to the weights_generator, but this was ignored.
	  Now uses the CFProjection.weights_bounds parameter, which has the
	  desired effect.

2005-12-07  ceball

	* [r1649] topo/analysis/featuremap.py,

	  topo/base/simulator.py,
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testactivitypanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/__init__.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  topo.base.simulator stores a list of objects that have asked to
	  be notified when the active_sim changes. These objects must have
	  a notify_of_active_sim() method, and this will be called when the
	  active_sim changes. The objects can do whate?\004ver they need to
	  once they receive this call, including changing their simulator.
	  This means there is no need to store the 'active gui'
	  (topoconsole) in the registry. TopoConsole is also only
	  associated with one PlotEngine, so it is clarified. Added
	  some?\004 HACKALERTs about further changes that are required.

	* [r1648] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added hackalert about loading a script.

	* [r1647] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Minor update to 'help' variable names. Added hackalert about help
	  items.

	* [r1646] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Removed refresh_title() method. The simulator name used to be
	  printed in the titlebar. Ever since that was removed, the title
	  of the window has stayed constant, so now it's set in the
	  TopoConsole constructor. Also removed some stray comments I left
	  behind a while ago.

	* [r1645] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Removed unused import.

	  - use neighborhood_kernel_generator as a callable object instead

	  Parameters that are class attributes of a TopoObject class
	  inherit from Parameters with the same name in super classes of

	  set to be a new Parameter. Updated the documentation.

2005-12-06  ceball

	* [r1639] topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  Added a comment (and some code temporarily in a comment).

	* [r1638] topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  Made a method that does the inheritance for a Parameter, given
	  the list of base classes of the TopoObject that owns the
	  Parameter.

	* [r1637] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Precedence constants for scale is no longer required since
	  Parameters can inherit from those in the owning TopoObject's
	  superclasses.

	* [r1636] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Added a note to myself.

	* [r1635] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  'precedence' constants are no longer required since Parameters
	  can inherit from those in the owning TopoObject's superclasses.

	* [r1634] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  A Parameter's slots all default to None so that the TopoMetaclass
	  knows when to try inheriting from the superclasses of the
	  TopoObject that owns the Parameter.

	* [r1633] topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  Code to allow Parameters inside a TopoObject to inherit from
	  Parameters with the same name in super classes of the TopoObject
	  (just on creation of the TopoObject, for the moment).

2005-12-06  jbednar

	* [r1632] topo/base/topoobject.py:

2005-12-06  yfsit

	* [r1627] topo/learningfns/basic.py:

2005-12-05  jdepaula

	* [r1622] topographica_script.py:
	  importing inlinec causes the same system fault that not importing

	* [r1621] topographica_script.py:
	  Added source comment about need to import inlinec.

	  topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/base/sheetview.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheet.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheetview.py:
	  Got rid of the function sheet_view() in Sheet (sheet.py) and in
	  CFSheet (connectionfield.py). Now, the sheet_view() is always
	  created explicitly, as well by get_view in CFProjection (for a
	  UnitWeight view), or by specific function such as measure_or_pref
	  or measure_activity;(eventually, we might want to make this
	  process more uniform by creating measure_weight() and
	  measure_projection() functions). Then, we access the sheet_view
	  by directly looking for it in a sheet_view_dict. Changes have
	  been made accordingly in sheetview.py,testsheet.py and
	  testsheetview.py.

	* [r1617] topo/plotting/plotengine.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotengine.py,
	  topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py:
	  Added a parameter simulator in the __init__ fucntion for
	  PlotGroups. The simulator has to be passed when creating the
	  PlotGroup (generally from the plotengine, but also from
	  InputParamsPanel). It allows to get rid of the call to
	  active_sim() in PlotGroup. Corrected the calls in plotengine.py,
	  inputparamspanel and testplotengine.py.

	  topo/tests/testfeaturemap.py:
	  topo.base.simulator tests if there is an active_sim and prints a

	  passing a Simulator back and forth between methods.

	* [r1607] topo/analysis/featuremap.py,
	  topo/commands/basic.py:
	  topo.base.simulator tests if there is an active_sim and prints a
	  warning if not, so callers don't need to do that. No longer
	  passing a Simulator to methods in topo/commands/basic.py as we
	  intend not to have more than one at a time.

	  topo.base.simulator now contains the methods get_active_sim() and
	  set_active_sim(). get_active_sim() will print a warning if there
	  is no active_sim, meaning callers do not have to do the test
	  themselves.

	* [r1598] topo/tests/testplotengine.py:
	  Started re-writing testplotengine according to the changes in the
	  file. The test is not truly working yet and cannot be use for
	  testing (it does not crash though, but is not relevant).

	* [r1597] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added the possibility to pass a string as a sheet_filter (instead
	  of the only possibilities being to pass None or a function).

	* [r1596] topo/plotting/plotengine.py:
	  Clarified the doc, added some alerts, get rid of unused import.

2005-12-04  julienciroux

	* [r1595] topo/tests/__init__.py:
	  Added testoutputfnsbasic to the list of the import statement in
	  tests/__init__.py. Now the test is performed when running make
	  all topo/tests.

	* [r1594] topo/tests/testplot.py:
	  Continued to write testplot.py. The tests for plot.py are
	  complete, except for catching the exeption of an empty plot.

	  topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  - examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty and examples/hierarchical.ty use

	  - moved the declaration of output_fn() in GenericCFLF() to
	  IndentityCFLF().

	* [r1583] topo/learningfns/basic.py:
	  - Added a neighborhood_fn paramter (defaulted to gaussian) in
	  HebbianSOM.

	* [r1582] topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/sheets/cfsom.py:
	  - copied CFSOM.winner_coord() into HebbianSOM so that the winner
	  can be found within the learning function.
	  - radius in HebbianSOM is renamed to learning_radius and is now a
	  parameter of HebbianSOM instead of an argument in __call__().
	  - used patternfns.gaussian() instead of a hard-coded exponential
	  function to compute the neighbour radius.

	* [r1581] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,
	  topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py:
	  Changed a HACKALERT.

	* [r1580] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Added HACKALERT about using constants for the precedences - it's
	  pretty ugly.

	* [r1579] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Made use of Parameter ordering constants defined in
	  topo/patterns/basic.py.

	* [r1578] topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Changed Parameter ordering.

	* [r1577] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  The previous commit was a mistake - I forgot the save my changes.

	* [r1576] topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Made it easier to specify an ordering of PatternGenerator
	  Parameters by defining constant values for precedences of
	  standard and typical PatternGenerator Parameters.

	* [r1575] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Added note about pickling in the Parameter class docstring.

	* [r1574] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py,

	  Continued reorganization.

	* [r1571] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Updated class_parameters(). Removed exp() (it's in
	  arrayutils.py). Should clip_in_place() be in arrayutils.py
	  instead?

	* [r1570] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Removed an alert - it should have been in patterngenerator.py.

	* [r1569] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:

	  widgets be added in order of Parameter precedence (well, reverse
	  order).

	* [r1562] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Added function keys_sorted_by_value() to return the keys of a
	  dictionary sorted by value. Added a comment about the function
	  name 'dict_sort()', which I think should be changed.

	* [r1561] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Added 'precedence' attribute to Parameters. Precedence can be
	  used to specify an ordering for Parameters within a TopoObject,
	  which could be useful e.g. to order them in the GUI.

	  in topoconsole.py.

	* [r1557] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Minor re-organization of the file, just moved the code for
	  release_sheetviews to another place.

	* [r1556] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Continued to simplified plot.py. I created one more sub-function
	  called _make_hsv_matrices in order to cut plot() in more
	  comprehensive part. I also simplified the code by deleting unused
	  tests unused plot attribute (channel_views does not exist anymore
	  as we only need to keep a list of matrices but not the
	  sheet_views itself, therefore
	  _get_channel_views_from_sheet_view() is now
	  _get_matrices_from_sheet_view()). Added some doc and comments,
	  deleted some old alerts.

	* [r1555] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Corrected an error on the last commit.

	* [r1554] topo/analysis/featuremap.py,
	  topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py:
	  Continued cleaning up plot.py. Added comments erased old ones.
	  Reorganized the function _get_channel_views_from_view_dict(). I
	  also made change to the way name are handled, and so made
	  corresponding changes in featuremap.py, plotgroup.py and
	  inputsparampanel.py; it is still not really good the way name are
	  handled for the display and I left an Alert about it.

	* [r1553] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Continued to clean up the file. Added some alerts and deleted
	  some old ones, reviewed the doc and renamed and made private the
	  function _get_channel_views_from_view_dict().

	* [r1552] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Removed HACKALERT - filename can now be visible on

	* [r1551] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Uses os.path.normpath() to convert UNIX-style paths to the style
	  of the user's operating system.

	* [r1550] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Changed image filename's variable name to 'filename' - it's
	  clearer.

	* [r1549] topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Intermediate commit during reorganization. Filename Parameters
	  now work (in that the image can be changed - the behaviour of the

	* [r1548] topo/tests/testplot.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotengine.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotgroup.py:
	  Temporarily commented out some tests while re-organizing plot.py,
	  plotgroup.py and plotengine.py. They will be re-written very
	  soon.

	* [r1547] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Got rid of the function look_up_dict. The method get will be used
	  instead when passing None as a second parameter that is returned
	  if the key is not in the dictionnary.

	* [r1546] topo/plotting/plotengine.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotengine.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Corrected the import statement for PlotTemplate and
	  PlotGroupTemplate, now that they have been moved in
	  plotgrouptemplate.py.

	* [r1545] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Got rid of PlotTemplate that is now in plotgrouptemplate.py.
	  Reviewed the doc and corrected the import statement.

	* [r1544] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Got rid of PlotGroupTemplate and template definitions that are
	  now in plotgrouptemplate.py. Reviewed the doc and corrected the
	  import statement.

	* [r1543] topo/plotting/plotgrouptemplate.py:
	  Added a new file plotgrouptemplate.py that contains: the
	  PlotTemplate class (that was previously in plot.py) and the
	  PlotGroup class (previously in plotgroup.py), as well as the
	  definitions of the PlotGroupTemplate objects and their
	  record?\004ing in the registry (previously in plotgroup.py, too).
	  This way, there is a relatively short and clean file for the user
	  to add PlotGroupTemplate definition in, while benifiting at the
	  same time from the doc and the code contain in the PlotTemplate
	  and P?\004lotGroupTemplate class.

2005-11-30  ceball

	* [r1542] topo/base/parameter.py,
	  topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Added a Parameter called Filename. This takes a string specifying
	  the path to the file, but when asked for its value, returns the
	  path in the correct format for the operating system. Or at least,
	  it will but probably doesn't at the moment - see the HACKALERT.

	* [r1541] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Removed unused import statements.

	* [r1540] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Had been receiving the GeneratorSheet's x and y bounds switched
	  around (because of 'x/y hack patch' in GeneratorSheet, so it was
	  itself flipping x and y again. Now that GeneratorSheet passes the
	  actual bounds, this doesn't flip x and y anymore. Also simplified
	  the functions a bit.

	* [r1539] examples/hierarchical.ty:
	  Corrected LineGenerator's bounds.

	  topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  Changed import of weave to import of inlinec wrapper.

	* [r1537] topo/base/inlinec.py:
	  Added named_parameters for inline to make remote reference calls
	  easier to handle

	* [r1536] topo/projections/optimized.py:
	  Removed an import star

	* [r1535] topo/base/inlinec.py:
	  Added named value dictionary parameter to functions

2005-11-29  jbednar

	* [r1534] examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty:
	  Clarified how constant was calculated

2005-11-29  julienciroux

	* [r1533] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Changed the sheet_view.view_info['src_name'] so that it displays
	  nicely in the GUI.

	* [r1532] topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py:
	  Changed plot so that it takes a sheet view dictionnary as a
	  calling parameter instead of a sheet. There is not the
	  possibility anymore to pass directly a sheet_view to Plot() but
	  only a sheet_view_dict and the three channels that are defined by
	  the template (e.g (plot_key,None,None) for UnitWeight.
	  plotgroup.py and inputparampanel have been changed accordingly.

2005-11-29  ceball

	* [r1531] examples/hierarchical.ty:
	  Made previous change less extreme - GeneratorSheets'
	  BoundingBoxes are now centered on (0,0). Before, it might have
	  looked like a bug to a new user.

2005-11-29  julienciroux

	* [r1530] topo/plotting/plotengine.py:
	  Very minor changes to comment.

	* [r1529] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Continued clarifying plotgroup.py. Now, it creates the plot for a
	  projection by calling plot with a plot_key, and no more list of
	  UnitViews is stored in the sheet_view_dict. Instead, when
	  creating the plots, a ProjectionPlotGroup will catch each unit
	  view with the corresponding Weights plot_key.

	* [r1528] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Continued to clean up and simplify the file. In particular, the
	  create_plots function for the UnitWeightPlotGroup does get the
	  location of the unit from the template anymore, but from the
	  plot_key passed when creating the PlotGroup. Also, in the same
	  function, made the call to Plot more general by adding the
	  possibility to have a hue and confidence parameter (it still does
	  not work though when adding 'Hue'='OrientationPreference') to the
	  UnitWeight template). Added comments and clarified others.

2005-11-29  jbednar

	* [r1527] topo/sheets/cfsom.py:
	  Changed Parameters to Numbers for clarity; should also get at
	  least lower bounds

	* [r1526] examples/cfsom_or.ty:
	  Fixed typo

	* [r1525] examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty:
	  Fixed density

	* [r1524] examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty:
	  Initial version based on cfsom_or.py

2005-11-29  julienciroux

	* [r1523] topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Fixed a little bug caused momentarily because I forgot to use
	  look_up_dict when requested a sheet_view from the
	  sheet_view_dict. Finally, I used sheet_view_dict.get(key,None),
	  and I think we could get rid of look_up_dict. I added some
	  comments about that. Also, modified some comments in
	  plotgorup.py.

2005-11-29  ceball

	* [r1522] topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  Removed 'patterngenerator hack patch to get x/y right outside of
	  kfs' because I think it was incorrectly swapping the x and y axes
	  of GeneratorSheets.

2005-11-29  julienciroux

	* [r1521] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Got rid of an hack that were dealing with the list of UnitView
	  that were added to the sheet_view_dict for a UnitViewPlotGroup.
	  Now, a given UnitWeight plot_key correspond to a single UnitView
	  in the sheet_view_dict. Some comments have been added in CFSheet
	  in connectionfield.py for some more future changes.

2005-11-29  ceball

	* [r1520] examples/hierarchical.ty:
	  Now uses a rectangular retina: no more hiding from flipped x and
	  y coordinates. (The box is also not centered about (0,0).)
	  Updated the LineGenerator's BoundingBox - not sure if it's the
	  right kind of size. Should LineGenerator.x's Boundin?\004gBox etc
	  also be changed slightly?

2005-11-29  julienciroux

	* [r1519] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Changed unit_view in ConnectionField so that it inserts UnitView
	  in the sheet_view_dict instead of one element list of UnitView.
	  Also modified the doc of unit_view.

2005-11-29  ceball

	* [r1518] topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  Moved PatternGeneratorParameter from topo.base.patterngenerator
	  to topo.patterns.base.

	* [r1517] topo/base/utils.py:
	  classname_repr() doesn't default to chopping off the suffix
	  'Generator'.

	* [r1516] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Added comment to find_classes_in_package().

	* [r1515] topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Moved PatternGeneratorParameter from topo.base.patterngenerator
	  to topo.patterns.base.

	* [r1514] topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Added statement to import all patterns, and a note to update the
	  comment.

	* [r1513] topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Moved PatternGeneratorParameter from
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py to topo/base/patterngenerator.py

	* [r1512] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Added comment for myself.

	* [r1511] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Added note to myself about reorganization of parametersframe.py

	* [r1510] topo/base/registry.py,
	  topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py,
	  topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  The registry no longer holds a list of PatternGenerators.
	  Instead, there is a class PatternGeneratorParameter that has a
	  method to perform the same function. PatternGeneratorParameter is
	  not finished, and is not in its final location.

2005-11-29  jbednar

	* [r1509] topo/base/inlinec.py:
	  Added optimized flag and made use exceptions

2005-11-29  ceball

	* [r1508] topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  Added comment about 'patch to get x/y right outside of
	  kernelfactories': I think it should be removed.

2005-11-29  julienciroux

	* [r1507] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/plotting/plot.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Re-organization of plot.py and corresponding changes in
	  plotgroup.py. Mostly, plot has been simplified and unused part of
	  the code have been erased. Now, to create a Plot you pass the
	  sheet and three channels, that will be set for each PlotGroup as
	  it is described in the template (it is planed that in the future,
	  the sheet_view_dict will be passed instead of the sheet). There
	  is still some issues for a ProjectionPlotGroup because of the way
	  the sheet_view_dict is constructed in this case (accepting a list
	  of sheet_views). There is also a similar problem for
	  UnitViewPlotGroup that is fixed by an hack in plot.py; that has
	  to be changed in unit_view in connectionfield.py. Finally,
	  handling of the label display is now wrong, which leads to a
	  double label in the activity panel. All this (relatively minor)
	  problems should be fixed quickly, and have a corresponding
	  JCALERT.

	* [r1506] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Got rid of an unused debug print.

2005-11-28  jdepaula

	* [r1505] topo/base/inlinec.py:
	  Changed the comments to not reference the dictionary.

	* [r1504] topo/base/inlinec.py:
	  Initial version. Using this package inline function is the same
	  as the Weave inline, except that it prints a failure warning if
	  Weave was not able to be imported.

	* [r1503] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Updated comment

2005-11-28  ceball

	* [r1502] topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py:
	  Changed a variable name to improve clarity.

	* [r1501] topo/base/utils.py,
	  topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py:
	  Made a function classname_repr() out of part of the
	  patterngenerator_names() function. classname_repr() is available
	  in topo.base.utils.

2005-11-28  julienciroux

	* [r1500] topo/analysis/featuremap.py,
	  topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Added the function measure_activity in featuremap.py; this
	  function just load up the activity sheet view for all the Sheets
	  in the simulator. t will eventually allow to get rid of the
	  sheet_view function in sheet, instead directly working ?\004on
	  the sheet_view_dict sheet attribute (I added an alert for that in
	  sheet.py). It remains to add measure_activity() instead of pass
	  in the command field of the activity PlotGroupTemplate; I have
	  done it and it works, but I could not commit plotgroup.py
	  ?\004since I am in the middle of some re-organization of the file
	  that will take some more time.

2005-11-28  ceball

	* [r1499] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Changed note to myself.

	* [r1498] topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Moved create_patterns() from ParameterFrame to InputParamsPanel
	  since it's not in general useful to ParameterFrame objects.

2005-11-28  jbednar

	* [r1497] doc/Downloads/index_text.php:
	  Fixed typo

2005-11-28  ceball

	* [r1496] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Changes to make the file easier to read (removed any unused
	  attributes, made functions private if they aren't used outside
	  the class).

	* [r1495] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Now uses sheet2matrixidx() from Sheet. This is an intermediate
	  check-in because there is no automatic scaling.

2005-11-28  julienciroux

	* [r1494] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Added temporary comments and alert for future file
	  re-organization.

	* [r1493] topo/plotting/plotengine.py:
	  Added a minor alert.

	* [r1492] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Added an alert about a PlotGroup.plots() being called for nothing
	  in the PlotGroupPanels.

2005-11-28  ceball

	* [r1491] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Made edge_average() more like the C++ version.

2005-11-27  jbednar

	* [r1490] topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Cleaned up docstring

2005-11-27  yfsit

	* [r1489] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/base/sheet.py,
	  topo/sheets/cfsom.py,
	  topo/sheets/composer.py,
	  topo/tests/testsheet.py:
	  Fixed the ALERTS on matrix2sheet and sheet2matrix.
	  Any transformation between matrix indices and sheet coordinates
	  should now be done through matrixidx2sheet and sheet2matrixidx.
	  The test cases are updated accodringly.

2005-11-26  julienciroux

	* [r1488] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py:
	  Added the sheet name for the plot_key of a ProjectionPlotGroup,
	  so that the connection can have the same name for two different
	  sheets, and still the plot_key will differentiate them. That
	  fixes a bug that was occuring with hierarchical.ty: when
	  switching form V1 to V2 the AfferentLeft and AfferentRight were
	  the same. It was because both ProjectionPlotGroup had the same
	  plot_key, without the sheet differentiating them. Also modified
	  some comments in plotgroup.py.

	* [r1487] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Got rid of the initialize_plot_list function for
	  ProjectionPlotGroup by adding some code in its create_plots
	  function. Now, initialize_plot_list is only implemented in the
	  superclass PlotGroup, and no sub-class have to re-implement it.
	  Also, minor changes in the comments.

	* [r1486] topo/plotting/plotengine.py:
	  Changed the default value of group_type to be None instead of
	  'BasicPlotGroup', because the case of a string was unused (it is
	  always a template that should be passed) in the function
	  get_plot_group; I also changed the comment about get_plot_group
	  and the possible changes still to be done on it.

	* [r1485] topo/plotting/plotengine.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotengine.py,
	  topo/tests/testplotgroup.py:
	  Continued clarifying PlotEngine and PlotGroup. I got rid of the
	  function sheet_filter that wasn't really useful (in both
	  plotengine and plotgroup), I got rid of the default values in the
	  make_plot_group function of PlotEngine to avoid confusion, got
	  rid of the corresponding JCALERT and modified some comments. I
	  changed the testplotengine and tesplotgroup accordingly.

2005-11-26  jdepaula

	* [r1484] doc/Downloads/win32_text.php:
	  Updated the formatting.

2005-11-26  julienciroux

	* [r1483] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Minor change to comment; also put the simulator to be an
	  attribute of the super-class PlotGroup, becasue it was re-defined
	  in every sub-classes anyway.

	* [r1482] topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py:
	  Changed the call to PlotGroup in InputParamPanel to match the
	  changes that have been done in PlotGroup.

2005-11-25  jbednar

	* [r1481] doc/User_Manual/index_text.php,
	  doc/shared/util.php:
	  Added note about missing user manual

	* [r1480] doc/Downloads/index_text.php:
	  Removed bogus option

	* [r1479] doc/Downloads,
	  doc/Downloads/.cvsignore:
	  More to ignore

	* [r1478] doc/Downloads/win32_text.php:

	* [r1477] README.txt,
	  WIN32_INSTALL.txt,
	  doc/Downloads/index_text.php,

	  Moved */text.php to */index_text.php

	* [r1474] doc/Makefile,
	  doc/shared/index.php:
	  Make PHP generation work for any source file named *_text.php,
	  generating *.html. For this to work, had to rename */text.php to
	  */index_text.php, so that index.html is just a special case of
	  the general rule.

2005-11-25  julienciroux

	* [r1472] topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py:
	  Minor change to comment.

	* [r1471] topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Minor change in prevision of future changes in PlotEngine (i.e. I
	  will get rid of most of the default parameter value in
	  get_plot_group and also re-order them)

	* [r1470] topo/plotting/plotengine.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Re-arranged the organization of both PlotEngine and PlotGroup.
	  Now, the PlotEngine only creates the PlotGroups when first
	  requested, and stores it in a dictionnary for later reuse; all
	  the plots generation is now done in each subclasses of PlotGroup,
	  instead of being done in the PlotEngine (i.e. the attribute
	  plot_list is now generated when the PlotGroup is created instead
	  of being passed as a parameter when creating the PlotGroup from
	  the PlotEngine). It makes the organization of the plotting
	  directory clearer, and solves some former bugs or limitations
	  (e.g. it is now possible to add whatever parameter in the
	  PlotGroupTemplates, like Hue or Confidence in the UnitWeights
	  PlotTemplate). Nevertheless, it is the first checked-in version,
	  but a lot remains to be done for cleaning up the file and
	  improving its clarity; a lot of JCALERT have been written for
	  this purpose. Also, the next step is to re-write the plot.py file
	  and then improve again plotgroup.py accordingly.

	* [r1469] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Minor changes to the comments (again).

	* [r1468] topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Minor changes to the comments.

2005-11-24  julienciroux

	* [r1467]
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testpreferencemappanel.py:
	  Got rid of the testpreferencemappanel.py file that have been
	  replaced by testbasicplotgrouppanel.

	* [r1466] topo/tests/tkgui/testplotpanel.py:
	  Got rid of the plotpanel.py file that have been replaced by
	  plotgrouppanel.

	* [r1465] topo/tests/tkgui/__init__.py:
	  Changed the __init__.py file in the topo/tests/tkgui/ directory
	  to replace testplotpanel by testplotgrouppanel and
	  testpreferencemappanel by testbasicplotgrouppanel.

	* [r1464]
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testbasicplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed the name of testpreferencemappanel.py to be
	  testbasicplotgrouppanel.py.

	* [r1463]
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Changed the name of testplotpanel.py to be testplotgrouppanel.py.

	* [r1462] topo/tkgui/preferencemappanel.py:
	  Got rid of the file preferencemappanel.py that have been replaced
	  by basicplotgrouppanel.py.

	* [r1461] topo/tkgui/plotpanel.py:
	  Got rid of the file plotpanel.py that have been replaced by

	  topo/tests/tkgui/testactivitypanel.py,
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testpreferencemappanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Changed references to the module preferencemappanel to be
	  basicplotgrouppanel in any files that used it.

	* [r1459] topo/tests/tkgui/testplotpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Changed references to the module plotpanel to be plotgrouppanel
	  in any files that used it.

	* [r1458] topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py:
	  Renamed preferencemappanel.py to be basicplotgrouppanel.py
	  (because PreferenceMapPanel and BasicPlotPanel are now merged
	  into BasicPlotGroupPanel).

	* [r1457] topo/plotting/plotengine.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py:
	  Renamed plotpanel.py to be plotgrouppanel.py

	  Clarified comment

2005-11-23  julienciroux

	* [r1455] topo/tkgui/plotpanel.py:
	  Minor change to the comments.

2005-11-23  ceball

	* [r1454] examples/ellen_arthur_square.pgm:
	  Removed square version of Ellen Arthur.

	* [r1453] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Updated to use new ellen_arthur.pgm. Added some comments.

2005-11-23  jbednar

	* [r1452] examples/ellen_arthur.pgm:
	  Added full-resolution non-square version

2005-11-23  ceball

	* [r1451] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Background value is now an edge average. Also changed range to
	  xrange in the sampling for loop because xrange is slightly faster
	  for looping.

2005-11-22  ceball

	* [r1450] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Changed to use normalization function from outputfns/basic.py,
	  and made the normalization function be a Parameter. Removed
	  unused import statement.

	* [r1449] topo/tests/testoutputfnsbasic.py:
	  Removed the duplicated docstring.

	* [r1448] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Just added a reference about infinity and NaN in Python.

	* [r1447] topo/tests/testfeaturemap.py:
	  Initial docstring was duplicated.

	* [r1446] topo/base/distribution.py:
	  Added reminder that we planned to refine the definition of
	  selectivity for non-cyclic distributions.

	* [r1445] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Changed how parts of retina with no image get an activity (no
	  change to behavior yet.

	* [r1444] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Image no longer wraps when it's made smaller than the retina.

	* [r1443] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Image's methods are no longer used for resizing.

2005-11-22  jdepaula

	* [r1442] WIN32_INSTALL.txt:
	  Removed two steps for Weave integration, since they are now part
	  of the CVS distribution.

	* [r1441] topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/projections/optimized.py:
	  Split multi-arg inline string into individual entries in list.

	* [r1440] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Changed float('inf') reference to the inf variable.

2005-11-21  jdepaula

	* [r1439] topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  Changed bzero in inlines to memset

2005-11-21  ceball

	* [r1438] topo/patterns/image.py:
	  Initial version. Added so that I can track changes - the file
	  will probably by split up and/or moved.

	* [r1437] examples/ellen_arthur_square.pgm:
	  Added as a sample image to use as retinal input.

2005-11-21  jdepaula

	* [r1436] WIN32_INSTALL.txt:
	  Added painful process to get Weave to work with Topographica
	  under Windows

2005-11-21  yfsit

	* [r1435] topo/base/utils.py:
	  a little faster crop_in_place

2005-11-20  yfsit

	* [r1434] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/utils.py:
	  - a more efficient clip_in_place()
	  - documentation of ConnectionField.change_bounds().

2005-11-16  julienciroux

	* [r1433] topo/tests/testoutputfnsbasic.py:
	  Error on the last commit; correction of this error in the test
	  file for outputfnsbasic.

	* [r1432] topo/outputfns/basic.py,
	  topo/tests/testoutputfnsbasic.py:
	  Fixed the JCALERT about DivisiveLpNormalize; all the
	  function/procedure in the file /outputfns/basic.py are now
	  working; the testoutpufns has been fixed too. Nevertheless, the
	  return x statement have still to be removed and the calls to be
	  changed in any files using these procedures (though it seems to
	  work fine when creating no intermediate copy and yet keeping a
	  return statement); also note that for the moment the test file
	  test both cases: procedure and function calls.

	* [r1431] topo/plotting/plotengine.py,
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testactivitypanel.py,
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testpreferencemappanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/preferencemappanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py:
	  Merged PreferenceMapPanel and BasicPlotPanel in a unique class
	  BasicPlotGroupPanel (currently still in the file
	  preferencemap.py), and got rid of the associated JABHACKALERT;
	  changed the name accordingly in any file that used them;it
	  remains to change the name of the file preferencemappanel.py to
	  basicplotgrouppanel.py (and also plotpanel.py to
	  plotgrouppanel.py), also to write a function measure_activity()
	  to pass to the Activity PlotGroupTemplate instead of pass for the
	  moment; added a JCALERT for that in preferencemappanel.py.

	* [r1430] topo/plotting/plotengine.py,
	  topo/tests/tkgui/testplotpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/plotpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/preferencemappanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Changed the name of the PlotPanel class to be PlotGroupPanel, and
	  got rid of a JABHACKALERT on this occasion. I added a JCALERT
	  though, because I think we should change the name of the file
	  plotpanel.py to plotgrouppanel.py, and also the name of the
	  PlotGroupPanel sub-classes (e.g. BasicPlotPanel).

	* [r1429] topo/tkgui/plotpanel.py:
	  Got rid of an unused function (enum) and its associated JABALERT.

	* [r1428] topo/plotting/plotengine.py:
	  Forgot to copy a comment.

	* [r1427] topo/plotting/plotengine.py:
	  Continued to add comment for future re-organization of the file;
	  re-wrote a part of the code and commented out the former one: now
	  it is possible to add more things in Projection and Unit Weights
	  PlotTemplate without being stopped at the PlotEngine level
	  because the choice of plot is done according to the name of the
	  PlotTemplates rather than what are their channels. The next step
	  is to re-write plot.py so that to obtain colored plot in all the
	  cases if we wish to.

	* [r1426] topo/plotting/plotengine.py:
	  Added some JCALERT and comment for preparing the re-organization
	  of the file; also commented out some part of the code that seems
	  not to be used (It has been left in comment to help re-writing
	  the file later).

2005-11-16  yfsit

	* [r1425] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  import CFProjection from topo.projections.basic instead of
	  topo.base.connectionfield.

	* [r1424] topo/projections/basic.py:
	  added topo.projection.basic so that CFProjection can be imported
	  from topo.projections.

2005-11-16  ceball

	* [r1423] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Removed another unused import statement.

	* [r1422] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Removed unused import statement. Folded functions within
	  SquareGratingGenerator and SineGratingGenerator. Corrected error
	  that was having no effect: I don't understand why params.get()
	  statements are present (so I added a note about that).

	* [r1421] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Missed an update on the last commit. For a SquareGrating to have
	  horizontal bars at orientation=0, the sin() function must depend
	  on the y coordinate rather than the x coordinate (see previous
	  log message).

2005-11-15  ceball

	* [r1420] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Sorted out import statements.

2005-11-15  jdepaula

	* [r1419] WIN32_INSTALL.txt:
	  Added directions to the lissom_or.ty file for cutting Weave out
	  of the Windows port.

2005-11-15  julienciroux

	* [r1418] topo/plotting/plotengine.py:
	  Started to clean up plotengine.py in the perspective of
	  simplifying it a lot in the future: added comments to help, added
	  JCALERT.

	* [r1417] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Got rid of an irrelevant CEBALERT.

2005-11-15  ceball

	* [r1416] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Made setup_xy be a private method of PatternGenerator.

	* [r1415] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Made transform_coordinates() be a private function of
	  PatternGenerator.

	* [r1414] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Made produce_pattern_matrices() be a private function of
	  PatternGenerator.

	* [r1413] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Removed an item under a JABHACKALERT. Functions from sheet.py are
	  already used.

	* [r1412] examples/cfsom_or.ty:
	  Made the default Gaussian more like lissom_or.ty's by having it
	  wider than it is high.

	* [r1411] topo/base/patternfns.py:
	  Changed gabor() also to vary sinusoidally with the y coordinate
	  (see previous log message).

	* [r1410] topo/base/patternfns.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  The previous commit of patterngenerator.py caused the x and y
	  values to be swapped: it turns out the rotations were not so
	  mysterious! However, I think the x matrix was being setup
	  incorrectly; it should have been rotated in the opposite sense.
	  Now that the matrices are setup correctly, it makes sense to
	  refer correctly to x and y in the various functions that use the
	  x and y matrices. For example, for a SineGrating to have
	  horizontal bars at orientation=0, the sin() function must depend
	  on the y coordinate rather than the x coordinate.

	* [r1409] topo/tests/testoutputfnsbasic.py:
	  Corrected the test file for the outputfns so that it test both
	  the procedure and the function call; also added some comments to
	  clarify the situation.

	* [r1408] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Got rid of the clip_in_place function that have been put in
	  utils.py; got rid of the JABALERT! about the x.savespace(1);
	  added some JCALERT about the fact that we kept the return
	  statement for the moment and also about DivisiveLpNormalize that
	  could not have been made to work as a procedure.

	* [r1407] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Moved the function clip_in_place from outputfns/basic.py to
	  utils.py; also add some comment about the fact that I did not
	  find any convenient matrix function to use for replacing the for
	  loop

	* [r1406] topo/tkgui/preferencemappanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Got rid of the unused call to get_event_processor in the
	  subclasses of PlotPanel; this function is almost not used
	  anywhere now, and we might be able to get rid of it.

	* [r1405] topo/plotting/plotengine.py:
	  Got rid of unused lines in plotengine.py

	* [r1404] topo/base/patternfns.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Removed a mysterious 90-degree rotation from patterngenerator.
	  Patterns now seem to be drawn at the conventional orientation.
	  Updated line(), which had been changed to be horizontal for the
	  tutorial. 'height' and 'width' are still probably confusing
	  labels.

	  changed the instruction on how to run the _CPointer classes.

	* [r1385] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/projections/optimized.py:
	  - change response_fn and learning_fn of CFProjection_CPointer
	  into Parameter.
	  - remove the storing of normlaize_fn in ConnectionField. The
	  function to normalize the weights are passed into __init__ and
	  change_bound instead.

	  Updated images to use line with a thickness that stops the retina
	  appearing monochrome.

	* [r1363] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Changed default thickness and smoothing of LineGenerator, and
	  added a default scale parameter. This allows users of the
	  tutorial to see reasonable responses without having to adjust the
	  scale themselves.

	* [r1362]
	  doc/Tutorial/images/activity_line.png,

	* [r1360] doc/Tutorial/text.php:
	  Fixed mistake introduced by JAB. You'd think after all these
	  years around LISSOM that he'd understand it.

	* [r1359] doc/Tutorial/images/or_map.png,
	  doc/Tutorial/images/projection.png,
	  doc/Tutorial/images/test_pattern.png,
	  doc/Tutorial/images/unit_weights_0_0.png,
	  doc/Tutorial/text.php:
	  Updated tutorial with screenshots from the new saved network
	  (v.1.3), and using a line as the demonstration pattern.

	* [r1358] examples/lissom_or_20000.typ:
	  Resaved the network so that first activity pattern viewed by a
	  user is not some crazy-ass wiggly line. (I was messing with the
	  input patterns before I saved the network.

	* [r1357] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Adjusted default properties of LineGenerator() to give a
	  reasonable response on lissom_or.ty.

	* [r1356] topo/base/patternfns.py:
	  Changed variable name x to y in line() as it better describes the
	  idea.

	* [r1355] examples/lissom_or_20000.typ:
	  New pickled network that was trained to 20000 with corrected
	  LateralExcitatory bounds (see log message for examples/lissom.ty
	  v.1.9).

	* [r1354] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Changed BoundingBox dimensions for final LateralExcitatory change
	  of bounds at 2000 iterations. Previously it was trying to enlarge
	  the bounds for a 48x48 V1.

	* [r1353] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Corrected LineGenerator so that an orientation of zero is
	  horizontal.

2005-11-08  jbednar

	* [r1352] topo/__init__.py:

	* [r1351]
	  doc/Tutorial/images/unit_weights_0_0.png,
	  doc/Tutorial/text.php:
	  Minor edits -- first complete version!

2005-11-08  julienciroux

	* [r1350] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added a function sort_plots() that sort a list of plots according
	  to their src_name (in plot.view_info['src_name']); it is then
	  applied in the plots() method of PlotGroup to sort the bitmap
	  list in alphabetical order; the function plots() ?\004is
	  overwritten in the ProjectionPlotGroup so that it does not sort
	  in this case (because it would otherwise sort the UnitView
	  constituting the projection plot)

	* [r1349] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Erased an unused comment

	* [r1348] topo/plotting/plotengine.py:
	  Minor change in comment

	* [r1347] topo/tests/testplotengine.py:
	  Changed the test for plotengine so that it does not call the
	  function _sheet anymore (because it has been erased)

	  Updated tutorial screenshots and recorded time to measure an OR
	  map as about 30 sec.

	* [r1345] topo/commands/basic.py:
	  Added hack to restore random properties of gaussian generators to
	  make cfsom_or and lissom_or work after unpickling.

	* [r1344] topo/base/topoobject.py:
	  Now when being pickled, TopoObjects save their class attributes.
	  Currently this only gets attributes from the object's class, not
	  from any superclasses (see hackalert). There is a problem with
	  this implementation: e.g. in the lissom_or.ty example, the random
	  x,y,orientation parameters are not pickled correctly.

	* [r1343] examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Changed BaseN to 48.0.

	* [r1342] examples/lissom_or_20000.typ:
	  Saved network for lissom_or.ty with a 48x48 V1

2005-11-07  ceball

	* [r1323] topo/tk/topoconsole.py:
	  Updated 'Help' menu with 'reference manual', 'tutorial', and so
	  on. These should launch a browser (unless one is already open),
	  and load the correct page. If a browser was open, it should bring
	  it to the front - but I am skeptical about that. I have only
	  tested this on DICE so far, where it works. If it doesn't work
	  for you, please let me know. If you think the list should be
	  different, you're welcome to change it. Should we include the
	  python documentation locally? It would have to be made - that
	  seems to take a while.

	  examples/hierarchical.ty,

	  Cleaned up comments

2005-11-05  ceball

	* [r1232] examples/lissom_or.ty,
	  topo/base/patternfns.py:
	  patternfns.py is back to using the conventional definition of a
	  Gaussian. lissom_or.ty adjusted so that it continues to match
	  LISSOM, which does not use the same definition (doesn't use the
	  factor of 0.5 in the exp's argument.

	* [r1231] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Changed use of deprecated uses of String.capitalize() to
	  string_itself.capitalize(). Added HACKALERT about names of maps
	  and what the GUI does with them.

	* [r1230] topo/commands/basic.py,
	  topo/tk/topoconsole.py:
	  Moved save_snapshot() and load_snapshot() to topo.commands.basic.
	  topoconsole now asks for the filenames, and uses an extension
	  .typ for saved networks. That obviously stands for 'topographica
	  pickled network'. save_ and load_snapshot() in?\004
	  topo.commands.basic do nothing to the filenames. Maybe
	  topoconsole shouldn't either? Currently, whatever the user types
	  in the filename box will have .typ added to it.

2005-11-05  jbednar

	* [r1229] examples/hierarchical.ty:
	  Added extra areas and connections as examples of a hierarchy

	* [r1228] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:

2005-11-05  yfsit

	* [r1222] topo/plotting/bitmap.py,
	  topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  change max(max(array)) to max(array.flat). max(array), where
	  array is a 2D matrix is ill-defined and gives unexpected resulted
	  sometimes.

2005-11-04  yfsit

	* [r1221] topo/sheets/lissom.py:

	  examples/lissom-or.ty:
	  Moved cfsom_example.py to cfsom_or.ty and lissom.ty to
	  lissom_or.ty

	* [r1218] examples/cfsom_or.ty,
	  examples/lissom_or.ty:
	  Slight name change

2005-11-04  julienciroux

	* [r1217] examples/gui_example.py,
	  examples/hierarchical.ty:
	  Changed the name of gui_example.py to be hierarchical.ty; also
	  changed the way the gui example connected V1, V2 and the Retinas
	  to something more realistic.

	* [r1216] examples/cfsom-or.ty,
	  examples/cfsom_example.py:
	  Changed the name of cfsom_example.py to be cfsom-or.ty

	* [r1215] examples/lissom-or.ty,
	  examples/lissom.ty:
	  Changed the name of lissom.ty to be lissom-or.ty

	* [r1214] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Added an hack so that a plot display the name from the
	  PlotTemplate instead of the name of the SheetView; it would need
	  more restructuring work to make sure this does not raise problems
	  in the future.

	* [r1213] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added space in the PlotTemplate's name so that the display is
	  nice when using them in the GUI.

2005-11-04  jbednar

	* [r1212] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Fixed apparent serious bug: SimulatorEvents were storing a
	  reference to the data, not the actual data, which means that the
	  data they provide when the event is delivered might be stale (or
	  the opposite of stale? too fresh?). Now that the data is
	  deepcopy-ed, can remove the __copy__ routine, which is good,
	  because it was skipping copying of the fn field, which could have
	  been causing some recent problems involving switching back and
	  forth between pattern_present and s.run()

	* [r1211] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Minor cleanup

	* [r1210] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Changed argument order for CFResponseFunctions and
	  CFLearningFunctions

	* [r1209] topo/sheets/cfsom.py:
	  Minor cleanup

	* [r1208] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/utils.py,
	  topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Renamed arguments to CFLearningFunctions

	* [r1207] topo/tk/plotpanel.py,
	  topo/tk/preferencemappanel.py,
	  topo/tk/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tk/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Changed all the PlotPanel's subclasses in the plots menu to
	  display the simulator time both at the top of the window and in
	  the label; got rid of the variable num_panel and of the number
	  that was printed at the top and was not incremented anyway

	* [r1203] topo/tk/plotpanel.py:
	  Moved standard set of buttons to the top so that too-large plots
	  can always be reduced

2005-11-04  yfsit

	* [r1202] tests/testfeaturemap.py:

	  topo/learningfns/basic.py,

	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  reduced the complexity in the argument list of CFResponseFunction
	  and CFLearningFunction.

	* [r1200] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Changed input_event() so that it does not depend on the name of
	  the projection to detect a new iteration.

	  Got rid of 'Active Simulator=' in the title of the topographica
	  console

	* [r1194] topo/tk/projectionpanel.py:
	  Changed the title of the window for the projection panel: now
	  density is no more specified in the title, there is no period in
	  the middle and it fits in when opening the window.

	* [r1193] topo/tk/preferencemappanel.py:
	  Got rid of the period at the end of the title in the Preference
	  Map panel.

	* [r1192] topo/plotting/plotengine.py:
	  Commented out unused function; add commentary for helping future
	  cleaning up of the file.

	* [r1191] topo/tk/plotpanel.py:
	  Got rid of an unused comment

	* [r1190] topo/tk/cfsheetplotpanel.py,
	  topo/tk/inputparamspanel.py,
	  topo/tk/preferencemappanel.py,
	  topo/tk/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tk/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Changed the call to the PlotPanel constructor so that it is
	  consistent with the change made to plotpanel; also got rid of
	  unused and confusing default values.

	* [r1189] topo/tk/topoconsole.py:
	  Changed the call to PlotPanel (or one of its subclasses) so that
	  it does not rely on default values in the constructor but rather
	  on information contained in the PlotGroupTemplate. It was working
	  before only because the parameters were set?\004 to a default
	  value in each subclasses, but wouldn't work otherwise.

	* [r1188] topo/tk/plotpanel.py:
	  Cleaned up PlotPanel so that there is no need to pass any default
	  arguments (which was confusing); re-aranged the order of these
	  arguments; added documentation; added slight change so that to
	  reach consistency between all subclasses of Plo?\004tPanel.
	  Modified the call to PlotPanel _init_ in BasicPlotPanel.

	* [r1187] topo/base/projection.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Moved projections() from LISSOM to ProjectionSheet.

	* [r1186] topo/base/patternfns.py:
	  Corrected two syntax mistakes introduced by accident. Added
	  hackalert about use of the word 'ellipse'

	* [r1185] examples/lissom.ty,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Updated lissom.ty to use LISSOM.projections() method to access
	  projections (for changing projection learning rates and bounds),
	  rather than LISSOM.change_learning_rate() and .change_bounds().
	  Removed change_learning_rate() and change_bounds() from LISSOM.
	  LISSOM.projections() will be moved to projections.py.

2005-11-03  jbednar

	* [r1184] topo/base/connectionfield.py:
	  Removed illegal use of topo.learningfns

2005-11-03  ceball

	* [r1183] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Removed stray line I left by mistake.

	* [r1182] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Added hackalert detailing changes to make. I didn't make them
	  because I know this file is currently being edited and the
	  changes will clash.

	* [r1181] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Created a function projections() that returns a dictionary
	  {projection.name: projection}. Removed lateral_projections() and
	  afferent_projections(). Added hackalert to indicate that
	  change_learning_rate() and change_bounds() should be removed when
	  lissom.ty is updated.

	* [r1180] topo/base/patternfns.py:
	  Made __elipse() be a public function; updated other functions
	  accordingly and changed some ring() and disk() internal variable
	  names.

2005-11-03  jbednar

	* [r1179] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Added alert and removed apparently redundant code

2005-11-03  ceball

	* [r1178] topo/tk/topoconsole.py:
	  Added another note to myself for saving and loading.

	* [r1177] topo/tk/topoconsole.py:
	  Added further notes to myself for saving and loading.

2005-11-03  jdepaula

	* [r1176] topo/tk/plotpanel.py,
	  topo/tk/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tk/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Text fields now update when entered.

2005-11-03  yfsit

	* [r1175] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/projection.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  - Changed pre_sleep() in lissom.py such that the last iteration
	  is a pure learning phase without computing the new activity.
	  - pre_sleep() in lissom.py now calls activate(), which is a
	  method in the superclass ProjectionSheet.
	  - learn() moved into CFSheet.

2005-11-03  jbednar

	* [r1174] topo/tk/preferencemappanel.py:
	  Added label for update command widget

	* [r1173] Makefile:
	  Made docs depend on all Python files

	* [r1172] topo/tk/inputparamspanel.py:
	  Clarified documentation

2005-11-02  jbednar

	* [r1171] topo/tk/plotpanel.py:
	  Fixed comment

	* [r1170] topo/tk/topoconsole.py:
	  Moved BasicPlotPanel to plotpanel.py

	* [r1169] tests/tk/testactivitypanel.py,
	  topo/tk/basicplotpanel.py,
	  topo/tk/plotpanel.py:
	  Moved BasicPlotPanel to plotpanel.py

	* [r1168] topo/tk/preferencemappanel.py:
	  Cleaned up comments and removed unused items

	* [r1167] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Added alerts and cleaned up documentation. Changed clip to
	  clip_in_place

2005-11-02  jdepaula

	* [r1166] topo/tk/cfsheetplotpanel.py,
	  topo/tk/plotpanel.py,
	  topo/tk/projectionpanel.py:
	  Change so widgets refresh independent of auto-refresh.

	* [r1165] topo/tk/projectionpanel.py:
	  Removed MakeStaticFunction import

	* [r1164] topo/tk/inputparamspanel.py,
	  topo/tk/plotpanel.py,
	  topo/tk/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tk/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Changed MakeStaticFunction to the @staticmethod operator.

	* [r1163] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Removed MakeStaticFunction. Found the @staticmethod operator

	* [r1162] topo/tk/plotpanel.py:
	  Oversight, need to check height as well as width for canvas
	  resizing

2005-11-02  ceball

	* [r1161] topo/base/patternfns.py:
	  Forgot to save all my changes last time.

2005-11-02  julienciroux

	* [r1160] tests/testoutputfnsbasic.py,
	  topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Transformed the output functions so that they don't create
	  intermediate copies of the array; rewrote a clip function for
	  this purpose; left the return statement so that I did not have to
	  change all the call to output functions in the rest ?\004of the
	  code. Modified the test file so that it calls procedures instead
	  of function.

	* [r1159] topo/tk/preferencemappanel.py:
	  Got rid of unused comments; added some comments about
	  JABHACKALERTs that I believe are obsolete.

2005-11-02  ceball

	* [r1158] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Removed comment after renaming user-visible variables.

	* [r1157] examples/gui_example.py,
	  tests/testpatternpresent.py,
	  tests/testplotfilesaver.py,
	  tests/tk/testplotpanel.py:
	  Changed LineGenerator's 'width' parameter to 'thickness'.

	* [r1156] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Changed disk() and ring() to be elliptical, so changed the
	  parameters of DiskGenerator and RingGenerator to match (e.g. they
	  have orientation now, radius has been replaced with height and
	  width... Changed LineGenerator's 'width' parameter to 'thickness'
	  (sorry this is in the same commit).

	* [r1155] topo/base/patternfns.py:
	  Changed disk() and ring() to be elliptical.

2005-11-02  julienciroux

	* [r1154] topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Removed the call to start() in the run() method: an
	  EventProcessor is now start()ed when it is add()ed to the
	  simulator. Merged _continue() into run() since run() only called
	  continue after no longer starting the EventProcessors.

2005-11-02  jbednar

	* [r1153] examples/lissom.ty:
	  Restored training of one iteration, due to strange bug with the
	  event queue that's being addressed separately

	* [r1152] topo/projections/kernelprojection.py:
	  Removed strange Constant response_fns

	* [r1151] topo/tk/inputparamspanel.py:
	  Trivial reorganization for clarity

2005-11-02  ceball

	* [r1150] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Activity is now colored by OrientationPreference, if it has been
	  measured. This is ok while we're only talking about orientation
	  maps.

2005-11-02  jbednar

	* [r1149] topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Added ALERTs

	* [r1148] topo/tk/projectionpanel.py:
	  Increased padding slightly

2005-11-02  jdepaula

	* [r1147] topo/tk/topoconsole.py:
	  Added test before trying to open a panel.

	* [r1146] topo/tk/inputparamspanel.py,
	  topo/tk/plotpanel.py,
	  topo/tk/projectionpanel.py,
	  topo/tk/unitweightspanel.py:
	  Added valid_context()

	* [r1145] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Added a wrapper that allows Static class functions.

	* [r1144] topo/tk/projectionpanel.py:
	  Reduced space between projection plots.

	* [r1143] topo/tk/plotpanel.py:
	  Patch so that if any plot size changes, the canvases are
	  recreated.

2005-11-02  yfsit

	* [r1142] examples/lissom.ty,
	  topo/projections/kernelprojection.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  LISSOM does not use the pointer implementation and so does
	  lissom.ty.
	  A new subclass, LISSOMPointer, is added which uses the pointer
	  implementation.

2005-11-01  julienciroux

	* [r1141] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Modified the measure_or_pref function so that we can pass some
	  parameter such as: scale, offset, freq of the SineGrating used
	  for measuring the map; user_function which by default is
	  '_sinegrating_present' (but gives the possibility to als?\004o
	  write _gaussian_present and change it when calling
	  measure_or_pref); display which enables to see the patterns
	  presented during the map measurement (display=True, False by
	  default); apply_output_fn that enables to disable the output
	  function (True by d?\004efault). All this parameters can now be
	  set from the command line in the Orientation Preference panel.

2005-11-01  jbednar

	* [r1140] topo/base/projection.py,
	  topo/commands/basic.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  Added apply_output_fn option to ProjectionSheet, for use with
	  e.g. pattern_present and measure_or_pref

2005-11-01  jdepaula

	* [r1139] topo/base/gendocs.py:
	  Made more powerful so that source code can be in subdirectories.

	* [r1138] Makefile:
	  Updated to use new gendocs.py revision that handles directories
	  in source code.

2005-10-31  julienciroux

	* [r1137] topo/tk/preferencemappanel.py:
	  Changed PreferenceMapPanel so that it works by passing the name
	  of a group template and all the parameter are initialized by
	  looking into the specified template; eventually we would like to
	  have the same file for other panel types

	* [r1136] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added a command parameter to the PlotGroupTemplates; this is the
	  default command to execute when opening or refreshing the panel
	  corresponding to this template

	* [r1135] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Added some debugging lines that enable to display the pattern
	  that have been presented when measuring the map; they are
	  currently commented out

	* [r1134] topo/tk/topoconsole.py:
	  Changed the command() method in PlotsMenuEntry so that it returns
	  a panel instead of nothing

2005-10-30  ceball

	* [r1133] topo/base/patternfns.py:
	  Simplified functions involving exp() after switching to
	  Numeric-24.0. The functions should be as robust as they were in
	  the previous version but the code is much clearer.

	* [r1132] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Clarified documentation string in exp().

	* [r1131] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Added an alternative to Numeric's exp() function; this one still
	  uses Numeric's, but works for any magnitude of argument.

	* [r1130] external,
	  external/.cvsignore,
	  external/Makefile,
	  external/Numeric-23.0.tgz,
	  external/Numeric-24.0.tar.gz:
	  Substituted Numeric-23.0.tgz with Numeric-24.0.tar.gz.
	  Numeric-24.0 handles nans and infs properly in arrays (rather
	  than raising errors).

	* [r1129] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Changed 'fringe' to 'smoothing'

2005-10-30  yfsit

	* [r1128] topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/learningfns/basic.py,
	  topo/projections/kernelprojection.py,
	  topo/responsefns/basic.py,
	  topo/sheets/lissom.py:
	  minor performance enhancement in CFDotProductP. Learning function
	  DivisiveHebbianP uses pointers to get the weight array instead of
	  using
	  C API.

2005-10-30  ceball

	* [r1127] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Renamed gaussian_width to fringe (I bet it gets changed before
	  you even read this). Changed names of parameters for ring to try
	  to make it match disk more obviously. Altered some default
	  parameter values.

	* [r1126] topo/base/patternfns.py:
	  Main change is to make all functions involving exp() behave more
	  as would be expected by a user, although the changes do not
	  affect current use of patternfns (e.g. as used by various
	  PatternGenerators); these changes are hacks. Corrected mistake in
	  previous commit made line() have same hack as ring() and disk().
	  Redefined gaussian fall-off to be exp(-0.5*(x/sigma)^2) rather
	  than exp(-(x/sigma)^2) (can easily be reverted - the change was
	  made for comparison). Slightly altered ring() to try to make it
	  match disk() more obviously.

2005-10-29  ceball

	* [r1125] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Added comment about how inf is created in here as 1/0 rather than
	  e.g. float('inf').

	* [r1124] topo/base/patternfns.py:
	  Fixed bug in Disk and Ring where there could be an attempt to
	  work with 0*inf. The fix is a hack, though. This file might be
	  better for using e.g. SciPy.

	* [r1123] topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Renamed FuzzyRing to Ring and fuzzy_ring to ring; updated
	  comments for Disk to reflect earlier change from FuzzyDisk

	* [r1122] topo/base/patternfns.py:
	  Renamed FuzzyRing to Ring and fuzzy_ring to ring

	* [r1121] topo/base/patternfns.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Renamed FuzzyDisk to Disk and fuzzy_disk() to disk().

	* [r1120] examples/gui_example.py,
	  tests/testpatternpresent.py,
	  tests/testplotfilesaver.py,
	  tests/tk/testplotpanel.py,
	  topo/base/patternfns.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Changed name of FuzzyLine to Line; fuzzy_line() changed to line()

	* [r1119] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Renamed user-visible instances of the variable 'theta' to
	  'orientation'

	* [r1118] tests/testcfsom.py,
	  tests/testfeaturemap.py,
	  tests/testpatternpresent.py,
	  tests/testplotengine.py,
	  tests/testplotfilesaver.py,
	  tests/tk/testactivitypanel.py,
	  tests/tk/testplotpanel.py:
	  Renamed user-visible instances of the variable 'theta' to
	  'orientation'

	* [r1117] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Now at least one frequency, phase, and orientation must be
	  specified for measuring the map (instead of 'not zero' of them).

	* [r1116] examples/cfsom_example.py,
	  examples/gui_example.py,
	  examples/lissom.ty,
	  topo/analysis/featuremap.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py,
	  topo/patterns/random.py:
	  Renamed user-visible instances of the variable 'theta' to
	  'orientation'

	* [r1115] topo/tk/inputparamspanel.py:
	  The function use_for_learning() (and so the button 'Use for
	  future learning') now works as it did originally; the
	  JABHACKALERT still applies.

2005-10-29  jbednar

	* [r1114] CONVENTIONS:
	  Minor clarification

	* [r1113] topo/base/sheet.py:
	  Clarified previous ALERT

	* [r1112] README.txt:
	  Clarified what is not yet done

	* [r1111] MILESTONES:
	  Updated to reflect recent progress

2005-10-27  julienciroux

	* [r1110] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Get rid of an unused commentary

2005-10-27  ceball

	* [r1109] topo/base/patternfns.py,
	  topo/base/patterngenerator.py,
	  topo/patterns/basic.py:
	  Made theta be a hidden parameter for fuzzy disk and ring since
	  they are currently symmetric; removed variable y from fuzzyline()
	  since it's not used; added comment about problem with fuzzyline.

2005-10-27  julienciroux

	* [r1108] topo/analysis/featuremap.py:
	  Added a raise error when trying to use 0 feature value in
	  measure_or_pref; added some debugging statement in an attempt to
	  display the pattern presented when measuring the map

2005-10-27  ceball

	* [r1107] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  Removed comment about scale-0 error; the problem wasn't here.

2005-10-27  julienciroux

	* [r1106] topo/base/utils.py:
	  Changed the norm function so that it works with the abs of the
	  elements; necessary in the case of the Lp norm

2005-10-27  ceball

	* [r1105] topo/base/patternfns.py:
	  Temporary fix to avoid 0/0 error.
	  Numeric.where(test,pass_expression,fail_expression) calculates
	  both pass_expression and fail_expression no matter what the
	  result of test. test cannot therefore be used, for instance, to
	  avoid divide-by-zero errors.

2005-10-26  ceball

	* [r1104] topo/base/patternfns.py:
	  Explicitly used Numeric's divide function to avoid divide-by-zero
	  errors.

2005-10-26  jbednar

	* [r1103] tests/tk/testtopoconsole.py:
	  Fixed broken tests, caused by eliminating topoconsole's copy of
	  the simulator

2005-10-26  julienciroux

	* [r1102] tests/testoutputfnsbasic.py:
	  Finished to write the test file for the output functions defined
	  in topo/outputfns/basic.py

2005-10-26  jbednar

	* [r1101] README.txt:
	  Updated to match current state of the code

2005-10-26  ceball

	* [r1100] topo/base/patternfns.py,
	  topo/base/utils.py,
	  topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/sheets/cfsom.py:
	  Changed randomly worded notes about hacks to CEBHACKALERTs so JAB
	  can find them when searching for 'ALERT'

	* [r1099] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Hack so that when scale is zero the GUI does not cause an
	  exception. Presentation of scale-0 patterns to the network works.

2005-10-26  jbednar

	* [r1098] topo/tk/preferencemappanel.py:
	  Cleaned up comments

	* [r1097] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py,
	  topo/tk/topoconsole.py:
	  Removed unused plot

2005-10-26  ceball

	* [r1096] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Added comment about pickling.

	* [r1095] topo/plotting/plot.py:
	  Changed some warnings and messages to debugs so that users don't
	  see warnings every time they measure orientation maps (warnings
	  about no plots in the retina)

2005-10-26  julienciroux

	* [r1094] topo/plotting/plotgroup.py:
	  Added the PlotGroupTemplate for Preference Map

	* [r1093] topo/tk/preferencemappanel.py:
	  Removed Ocular Preference from the scrolled list; made the
	  associated measure_or_pref() command executed when entering or
	  refreshing the Orientation Preference plot

2005-10-26  ceball

	* [r1092] topo/tk/inputparamspanel.py:
	  Added note that 'use for future learning' button doesn't work
	  (and didn't before these most recent pickling modifications.

	* [r1091] topo/tk/topoconsole.py:
	  Added menu items to allow loading and saving a snapshot.
	  TopoConsole no longer stores the active simulator itself, it
	  instead gets it from the registry.

	* [r1090] topo/base/boundingregion.py,
	  topo/sheets/cfsom.py:
	  Basic support for pickling added; might not be required but as it
	  is a snapshot of the simulator's state can be saved and then
	  reloaded if topographica is started with the example in both
	  cases. Some of the changes will not be permananent ?\004but these
	  are noted.

2005-10-26  jbednar

	* [r1089] topo/tk/topoconsole.py:
	  Declare that orientation maps should use PreferenceMapPanel

2005-10-26  julienciroux

	* [r1088] topo/tk/preferencemappanel.py:
	  Changed so that in the GUI preference map menu, there is actually
	  the preference maps instead of the activity; works only for
	  Orientation Preference so far

	* [r1087] tests/testmeasurefeaturemap.py,
	  topo/analysis/featuremap.py,
	  topo/base/featuremap.py,
	  topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py:
	  Created new file topo/analysis/featuremap.py from
	  topo/base/featuremap.py and topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py

	* [r1086] tests/testfeaturemap.py:
	  Merged tests for featuremap and measurefeaturemap

	* [r1085] topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py:
	  Added the command measure_or_pref() for measuring an orientation
	  map; improved the user function sinegrating_present and made it
	  private

	* [r1084] topo/outputfns/basic.py:
	  Improved some comments

2005-10-26  jbednar

	* [r1083] topo/__init__.py:
	  Added analysis directory

	* [r1082] topo/analysis,
	  topo/analysis/.cvsignore,
	  topo/analysis/__init__.py:
	  Initial version

2005-10-25  ceball

	* [r1081] topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py:
	  Made measuring maps clearer (changed no functionality). Still
	  have to move sinegrating_present out

2005-10-25  julienciroux

	* [r1080] tests/testoutputfnsbasic.py:
	  First version of the test file for the output functions in
	  topo/outputfns/basic.py

	* [r1079] tests/testfeaturemap.py:
	  First complete version of the test file for featuremap; need to
	  clarify the definition of selectivity to actually finishing the
	  test file

2005-10-25  jbednar

	* [r1078] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Removed pickle support; doesn't seem to work yet

	* [r1077] topo/base/boundingregion.py:
	  Changed AARectangle to new-style class so that __slots__ is
	  meaningful; not necessarily completed. Made slots be weakly
	  private instead of fully private; this appears (?) to be
	  necessary for deepcopy

	* [r1076] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Changed indentation to match 4-space convention used elsewhere

	* [r1075] topo/base/parameter.py:
	  Removed unused code saving the __dict__ for pickling, because a
	  Parameter has no __dict__

	* [r1074] tests/testsimulator.py,
	  topo/base/simulator.py:
	  Changed Simulator.Event to non-nested SimulatorEvent to avoid
	  problems with pickle

	* [r1073] examples/lissom.ty:

	  topo/base/utils.py:
	  Moved functions cross_product and frange from
	  topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py to topo/base/utils.py; changed
	  MeasureFeatureMap so that it works with a user-defined function
	  rather than a string command; get rid of debugging statements and
	  u?\004seless commentaries in measurefeaturemap

2005-10-24  jbednar

	* [r1064] topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py,
	  topo/commands/basic.py,

	  topo/base/featuremap.py:
	  Modified the JABHACKALERT commentaries about the use of __add__

	  topo/base/connectionfield.py,
	  topo/base/simulator.py,
	  topo/projections/kernelprojection.py,
	  topo/responsefns/basic.py:
	  An enhanced implementation of CFDotProduct, called CFDotProductP,
	  that uses arrays of pointers to access the weights instead of
	  through the C API. This response function should only be used by
	  KernelPointerProjection, which is a new subclass of
	  KernelProjection that contains the extra data structure to store
	  the pointers array.

2005-10-24  ceball

	  updates to some comments; changed to work with altered
	  pattern_present

	* [r1044] topo/patterns/patternpresent.py:
	  Changed pattern_present so that saving/restoring previous input
	  patterns is done with a separate function; changed
	  pattern_present so that presentations where learning==False no
	  longer use a copy of the simulator's event list - this might be
	  the wrong thing to have done.

	* [r1043] topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py:
	  Added a stack onto which the current input_generator can be
	  placed, and from which previous input_generators can be restored
	  .

2005-10-22  jbednar

	* [r1042] topo/projections/kernelprojection.py:

2005-10-21  ceball

	* [r1033] tests/testdistribution.py,
	  tests/testfeaturemap.py,
	  topo/base/distribution.py:
	  Distribution now wraps vector directions back into the axis
	  range. Directions used to come back as principal values from
	  arctan2 - now any tests that were expecting the principal value
	  rather than one within the axis range would fail, so they were
	  corrected.

2005-10-21  jbednar

	* [r1032] topo/plotting/plot.py,

	  Made it legal for a plot to be empty for some (or even all)

	  Added DynamicParameter class

	* [r1014] topo/plotting/plot.py:

	  Sliders created based upon the Parameters in the
	  PatternGenerator! Problem with Dynamics in Fuzzy Line

	* [r1006] topo/base/patterngenerator.py:
	  theta is defined for everyone. It needs to be a Number to have
	  soft bounds.

	  Added code to allow test to be run independently of runtests
	  script

	* [r1004] tests/testmeasurefeaturemap.py,

	* [r541] topo/cfsheet.py,
	  topo/sheet.py:
	  fixed cfsheet.py and sheet.py so that the all the unit tests are
	  passed.

	  The way that the weights in a connection field are initialized
	  was changed
	  quite significantly in the previous version of cfsheet (1.11).
	  This breaks one
	  test because the weights were assumed to be uniform in that
	  version. Now the
	  code first checks if the initial weight distribution is uniform
	  random. If yes,
	  then the code will follow the same flow as version 1.11. If no,
	  the flow will
	  fall back to 1.10. The main difference between these two version
	  is that 1.11
	  implements find the set of connection field boundary that matched
	  the C++
	  simulator and should be correct. In 1.10, the size seems to be
	  off by one
	  in some cases.

	  To fix the code so that all kinds of initial weight distributions
	  will have the
	  correct connection field boundary may require some significant
	  changes in
	  kernelfactory.py.

	  Support file for gui.py. Taken straight from LISSOM 5.0. No
	  Pydocs have been added yet

	* [r183] topo/gui.py:
	  Copied from LISSOM 5.0 python/. All LISSOM calls commented out so
	  the file is a driver with a lot of stubs and junk lines. Only
	  changes in this version include necessary fixes to get the window
	  to open under Topographica. Found that PMW 1.2 MUST be installed
	  to work with Python 2.3 and get this file to run.

	* [r182] external/Pmw.tgz:
	  Pmw version 1.2. Upgraded because Python 2.3 required a patch to
	  PmwMenuBar._addHotkeyToOptions that could not be worked around.

	* [r181] topo/dislindriver.py:
	  Changed the three test cases so they'll only run if the file is
	  Main--in other words the driver is now ignored, but left here as
	  an example of how to use the dislinplot file.

2004-04-11  joeraii

	* [r44] topo/inputsheet.py,
	  topo/kernelfactory.py:
	  Added FuzzyDisk and Rectangle kernels.

	* [r43] topo/inputsheet.py,
	  topo/kernelfactory.py:
	  Cleaned up version of input sheet. Parameters are correctly
	  passed to the
	  generator functions. Also Gabor is enhanced with more parameters.

2004-04-09  joeraii

	* [r42] topo/kernelfactory.py:
	  Added a preliminary version of fuzzy line, also cleaned up the
	  remaining kernel
	  factory definitions.

	* [r41] topo/inputsheet.py,
	  topo/kernelfactory.py:
	  New kernel factory without classes, and input sheet to reflect
	  these changes.
	  Some problems: Gabor probably doesn't work correctly, also there
	  may be an issue
	  with how parameters are being passed.

2004-04-02  joeraii

	* [r40] topo/inputsheet.py,
	  topo/kernelfactory.py:
	  Fixed the 90 degree rotation problem, also added a simple
	  generator for doing
	  translations. I'm not sure if it works like it should (i.e. if
	  each instance of
	  the generator is independent), however it does create the effect
	  of moving a
	  gaussian across the input area.

2004-03-31  joeraii

	* [r39] topo/kernelfactory.py:
	  Fixed a minor bug with the generic kernel factory.

2004-03-29  jp

	* [r38] examples/rfsom_example.py,
	  topo/rfsom.py,
	  topo/utils.py:
	  Add borders to RFSOM rf plot output.

	* [r37] Makefile,
	  topographica,
	  topographica-script.py:
	  Changed Makefile to generate main topographica script, so it
	  properly calls bin/python for each installation.

2004-03-26  joeraii

	* [r36] topo/inputsheet.py:
	  Little bug regarding TopoMetaClass resolved.

	* [r35] topo/inputsheet.py:

	* [r33] topo/kernelfactory.py:
	  Kernel factory cleanups .

	* [r32] topo/inputsheet.py,
	  topo/kernelfactory.py:
	  Updated to work with the TopoMetaClass, however I'm currently not
	  able to set
	  the default class attributes... Also added Sheet versions of Sine
	  Grating and
	  Gabor. More functions to come.

2004-03-25  jp

	* [r31] topo/base.py:
	  Added TopoMetaclass, to handle class-wide Parameter setting.

2004-03-18  joeraii

	* [r30] topo/inputsheet.py,
	  topo/kernelfactory.py,
	  topo/params.py:
	  Changed the kernel factory and input sheet to use the Parameter
	  model. Also
	  created some mix-in classes for input sheets.

2004-03-13  jp

	* [r29] topo/base.py:
	  added the base module

	* [r28] examples/image_example2.py,
	  topo/params.py,

	  topo/simulator.py:
	  Added the .pre_sleep() EP method.

	* [r27] topo/rfsom.py,
	  topo/simulator.py:
	  RFSOM cleanup + minor simulator changes

	* [r24] topo/inputsheet.py,
	  topo/kernelfactory.py:
	  New kernel functions. Not completely integrated with the kernel
	  sheet yet;
	  wating for the new parameters model.

2004-02-24  nn

	* [r23] topo/inputsheet.py,
	  topo/kernelfactory.py:
	  Cleaned up code and made the kernelfactory and inputsheet code
	  more generic.
	  Should now be trivial to begin adding other types of input sheet
	  functions
	  (other than gaussian).

2004-02-22  nn

	* [r22] topo/params.py:
	  Change params back to the original.

	* [r21] topo/inputsheet.py:
	  More generic version of gaussiansheet.py. However it only
	  supports gaussian
	  kernels.

	* [r20] topo/kernelfactory.py:
	  New version of kernelfactory that is faster, and does not crash.
	  However it may
	  be inconsistent in the ouput matrix size. This will be fixed
	  later.
